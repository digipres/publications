Common reasons are high costs of publishing, reluctance to share, as well as lack of journals focusing on research challenges specific to developing countries. The ongoing change towards open access and the rising popularity of institutional repositories allows for bridging the gap to developed countries. However, this still requires cultural, organizational and technical changes. In this paper, we describe a holistic approach for deploying open access repositories and building research data management services and increasing data curation skills. We describe how we identified users’ needs and necessary supporting systems and services. We also explain the rationale and challenges faced when implementing popular repository systems and share experiences in developing institutional data management policies. Finally, we provide common goals for a national roadmap. All these actions are the first step towards the preservation of both research outputs and cultural assets. The paper is based on our experiences from ROMOR project that helped in establishing policies, systems, and organizational workflows at four Palestinian universities.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2019-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2019"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:1080464","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:1080464/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The service offers both open source and proprietary systems and allows data and metadata to be shared openly if required. The platform has been developed through years-long consultation with the UK HE research sector and sector bodies, along with contributions from both in-house Jisc and third-party experts. The need for such a solution has arisen from the sector’s desires to achieve several, shared aims, including: greater collaboration; tackling the reproducibility crisis; enabling better research; and meeting funder requirements. \nJisc’s custom-built repository—the Jisc Research Repository—is part of the Jisc Open Research Hub. It’s built upon an extensive data model and rich messaging layer, providing users with a clean, simple, and easy-to-learn interface for the deposit, approval, and discovery of a range of outputs. In particular it allows for a seamless end to end experience for the user; from deposit straight through to preservation. Jisc’s position in the UK higher education / research sector, as well as the scale of the service provides us with many domain-specific insights to share with iPRES delegates, ranging from the broad methods mentioned above, down to individual design decisions informed by our research and domain expertise.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2019-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2019"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:1080465","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:1080465/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Preservation of metadata is important to ensure preservation of all relevant information in order to be able to access digital objects in the future. This includes all kinds of metadata, which contributes to the understanding of an object, e.g. preservation metadata as well as descriptive metadata.\nThe need for metadata is commonly accepted, but it is not as commonly accepted that metadata need to be preserved to the same extent as files. There are many challenges due to the fact that metadata are often updated. This is probably one of the reasons why there exist numerous examples of metadata being under backup only and not under bit preservation. \nPreservation of metadata is not just needed for future access of the objects, but also for re-establishment of repository systems after major breakdowns – or for establishment of a new repository as part of an exit strategy from a previous system. The latter case\nmay also mean that the metadata have to be structured in a way, which can be used by different systems supporting digital preservation.\nThis paper describes how the newly merged Royal Danish Library has created a digital preservation strategy to cope with these challenges, and discusses the background for choices made in this process.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2019-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2019"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:1079747","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:1079747/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

What is much less clear, however, is how much this would cost. In many cases, not enough consideration is given to the long-term cost of curating digital collections, often because very little is actually known about this aspect. As a result, such management costs are frequently not included in the ordinary operating expenses of the institutions in question. Moreover, many heritage institutions tend to assume that the long-term costs are very high, partly due to the exponential rise in the volume of material, whether digitised or born-digital. In many cases, incidental revenue (i.e. project income) is used to pay for longterm management costs. But is this assumption correct? And how can we control the cost of curating digital collections in the long term?","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2019-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2019"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:1079781","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:1079781/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Its time-based nature means it is tremendously underserved. However, current technology makes it possible to create automated transcriptions from audio, which can be used to implement granular search tools with high degrees of accuracy. This, together with building visualization tools that give the user the power to navigate audiovisual content easily, constitutes a unique opportunity to enhance access to audiovisual collections.\nAdditionally, although some preservation systems offer access platforms, these are not designed to display audiovisual content in its full potential. Aviary offers specialized access to audiovisual content with granular permissions, and fully searchable indexes and transcripts. Generic integrations with preservation systems such as Preservica and Archivematica are in being developed currently.

The Criteria are intended to help with developing requirements for, or evaluations of, preservation storage solutions; to seed discussions about preservation storage; or to use within digital preservation instructional material. The latest version of the Criteria contains sixty-one criteria grouped into eight categories: content integrity, cost considerations, flexibility, information security, resilience, scalability & performance, support, and transparency. \nThe key new development since the Criteria was presented at the iPRES 2018 workshop is a usage guide, developed to accompany the Criteria. It includes sections on key topics to consider for preservation storage in addition to the Criteria: risk management, independence, elements in establishing bit safety, and cost considerations.

With that aim, 1.5 million PDF files collected from Japanese IRs were analyzed with regard to file format, encryption, and metadata. Most PDF files did not conform to PDF/A. A total of 30.5% of PDFs were encrypted and many PDFs did not have embedded metadata. These results imply that PDF files in Japanese IRs have several serious problems for their long-term preservation.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2019-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2019"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:1081752","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:1081752/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

One of these content types was eBooks published as Mobile Apps. Research considered a relatively small number of apps in an attempt to better understand the preservation challenges associated with them and make recommendations for a way forwards. It found that whilst the content landscape is extremely varied, the technical challenges are similar for both Android and Apple apps. The greatest challenges appear to lie in the acquisition and access areas, particularly in enabling delivery to appropriate rendering environments and devices, though other challenges remain around the use of device sensors and content stored on remote servers rather than the user’s device. Whilst these challenges may be surmountable with sufficient resource and investment, the lack of growth in this content area in recent years makes large scale investment questionable.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2019-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2019"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:1081751","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:1081751/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Enabling this has, to date, been a difficult, time-consuming, relatively resource intensive, and tedious. In this paper, we show how we are on the verge of creating a new method and series of tools to simplify and automate the process of interacting with digital objects in their original software and greatly reduce the time and resource costs of doing so. We outline the history of the developments in the areas of emulation and software preservation that we have built on and we outline the concept of this set of tools and processes we call the “Universal Virtual Interactor”. We also discuss how the UVI is being created, and finally we discuss how it may be improved upon in the future and how it may be implemented in access and discovery tools.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2019-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2019"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:1081742","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:1081742/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

This paper will investigate how to express the provenance of Internet art as linked data. One of the standards that has emerged to describe the provenance of digital data is the W3C PROV. It provides a model which facilitates description of the entities, agents and processes involved in producing data. This generic model has proven to be applicable in various contexts, including the cultural heritage domain [1, 2]. However, its potential to describe the provenance of Internet art is not yet fully explored [3]. This paper demonstrates how the PROV model can be used to describe the provenance of Internet art by applying it to a case study from Rhizome’s ArtBase, an online archive dedicated to preserving works of Internet art. This paper is aimed at digital art conservators, digital curators, Web archivists and art historians.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2019-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2019"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:1081728","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:1081728/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The passive digital preservation strategy it follows matches the features of a written form contrasting with current active strategies that rather compare to orality. Micr’Olonys stores digital files as 2D barcodes whose content can be restored, using any general-purpose computer and scanner, by implementing the procedure described in a self-contained bootstrap that spans a dozen human-readable pages including a simple 2-page algorithm. In the future, Micr’Olonys aims to become a powerful preservation tool for complex formats and software, as well as the access key to DNA digital storage to archive massive amounts of data.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2019-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2019"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:1081750","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:1081750/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The belief that digital content can be appraised, acquired, described, and made accessible using the same methods as paper records can inhibit the development of end-to-end digital preservation programs. To start to address this challenge, I developed a collaborative model for digital knowledge transfer based on adult education theory. The model has shown great promise for building digital capacity, capability, and community amongst my colleagues at Library and Archives Canada. This paper outlines the concepts that drive the model, as well as the three steps that are required for its implementation. As analog preconceptions often influence the thinking of those who are responsible for relationships with records creators, as well as the acquisition and processing of digital content, such collaboration and capacity building is a necessity for the success of end-to-end digital preservation programs.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2019-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2019"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:1081749","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:1081749/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Due to lack of time and available staff, the Library decided that a third party digital preservation service would be the best solution. It could be acquired relatively quickly, and it wouldn’t require asking for funding to hire multiple dedicated staff to build a home-grown digital preservation system. Obtaining buy-in from stakeholders and finding a service that met Princeton’s needs proved to be a challenge, especially due to the sensitivity of student records in the collections, which would require a high level of privacy and encryption key maintenance in addition to standard data integrity and preservation processing tools. Throughout 2018, Princeton worked to partner with a service previously unavailable due to University data sovereignty requirements – Arkivum’s Perpetua – and work began to develop a Princetonspecific solution that met the needs of the University: Most importantly, geographically dispersed cloud storage locations, Princeton-based control over data integrity and authenticity checks, an encryption key management system for student records maintained by the vendor but managed by repository staff, and a reliable and quick exit strategy.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2019-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2019"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:1079915","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:1079915/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The certification of trustworthy data repositories (TDRs) custodian organizations that ensure data stewardship and longterm preservation by means of a standard such as the CoreTrustSeal is an established and recognized procedure to support long-term access to reusable data. Likewise, the FAIR Guiding Principles and the developing FAIR metrics have largely codified the contemporary discourse and policies on research data management and stewardship. The proximity of objectives between the CoreTrustSeal certification of TDRs and the implementation of FAIR Principles calls for a close examination of their overlaps and complementarities. In particular, the concept of FAIR data cannot be detached from the characteristics of the data infrastructure, the environment in which FAIR data objects reside. It is therefore necessary to examine, under which circumstances the assessment of FAIRness should be carried out at collectionor repository-level, and to what extent CoreTrustSeal certification can be considered positioning TDRs as enabling FAIR data.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2019-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2019"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:1079920","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:1079920/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

It is therefore as jargon-free as possible and gives organizations hands-on advise on which issues should be tackled first. The Score Model has the form of an online tool in which the user has to register for an account. They then have to answer 56 questions - separated in seven ISO 16363 inspired clusters - which result in a final report.

The ingest process often requires sifting through large amounts of data which may not always be sorted or categorized from the source/donor. It is possible to discover information that was not intended to be disclosed should the donor not be privy to the existence of said material. This issue is typically handled by communicating with the donor, however, if they have no relation to what has been uncovered in the data, further steps may need to be taken. If the data belong to or are about someone living, that person may need to be contacted, depending on the nature of the data discovered. If the person of interest is no longer living, legally there would no issue disclosing all information uncovered, how- ever, implications for living relatives must be considered should the disclosed information be potentially revealing or harmful to them. This can include hereditary health issues, political or religious views, and other sensitive in- formation. There are significantly more variables to con- sider, such as public interest and defamation which can heavily impact the decision process following the discovery of sensitive data, all whilst guided, but not necessarily enforced by law. This remains somewhat of a gray area as the entities handling such data are often exempt from these laws and principles, making these decisions ethically and morally based more so than legally. In this article, the Australian laws and policies that surround privacy issues, defamation, and data relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and culture are explored. The aim is to raise awareness on potential issues that may arise in collection institutions as well as potential threats already sitting in storage and the laws and policies that may serve as guidelines to help overcome/mitigate such issues.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2019-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2019"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:1079695","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:1079695/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Based on the open source software (OSS) Heritrix, NLC started project of collecting, cataloguing and archiving the government public information , important websites and webpages at home and abroad in 2005. The NLC accumulated abundant practical experience and united libraries nationwide to carry out web archiving and service jointly. In 2018, NLC carried out technology upgrade and developed a set of “Web Archiving and Service Platform” for distributed cloud storage infrastructure. The platform adopts a distributed cloud infrastructure and supports the management and use of at least 1 million metadata data, which enables the NLC to collaborate with multiple libraries (institutes) to conduct web collection services. This paper analyzes the construction ideas, technical routes and key technologies in detail based on the analysis the strategy of web archiving and the requirements for the system platform. It is hoped to provide reference for other institutes to carry out the related work.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2019-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2019"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:1082720","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:1082720/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The platform has been developed through years-long consultation with the UK HE research sector and sector bodies, along with contributions from both in-house Jisc and third-party experts. And was launched in July 2018.\nThe need for such a solution has arisen from the sector’s desires to achieve several, shared aims, including: greater collaboration; tackling the reproducibility crisis; enabling better research; enabling a better user experience; and meeting funder requirements.\nJisc’s custom-built repository—the Open Research Repository—is part of the Jisc Open Research Hub. It’s built upon an extensive data model and rich messaging layer, providing users with a clean, simple, and easy-to-learn interface for the deposit, approval, and discovery of a range of outputs. In particular it allows for a seamless end to end experience for the user; from deposit straight through to preservation.\nJisc’s position in the UK higher education / research sector, as well as the scale of the service provides us with many domain-specific insights to share with iPRES delegates, ranging from the broad methods mentioned above, down to individual design decisions informed by our research and domain expertise.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":null,"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2019-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2019"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:1082722","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:1082722/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Cooperation in sharing resources and knowledge is called for.\nIn the national context of the Netherlands the KB recently took the initiative to build the National Coalition for Digital Preservation. All relevant sectors of Dutch society are represented. Its aim is to develop a national infrastructure and to assign clear responsibilities. In the European arena the KB, together with the British Library, started the European Alliance for Permanent Access to the Records of Science. The Alliance works towards the widespread and joint responsibility for maintaining the records of science by all major stakeholders, including national governments and the EU.\nIn the global context the KB developed the concept of the 'Save Places Network'. This Network will include a limited number of institutions with certified digital archives for scientific publications, sharing responsibility for complete, world-wide coverage and allocate tasks accordingly.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["beijing"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2007-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2007"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294464","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:294464/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

At the time (early 2000s), the BnF used different storage media and technologies across the library, and had no unified responsibilities and processes. When the decision was made to overhaul the infrastructure and the software to have one repository to replace them all, the project designers reflected quite naturally that such an effort could and should benefit other libraries that had similar scalability issues. There were many obstacles to overcome after that generous impulse. First, finding the BnF's niche in the digital preservation landscape, at a time when it was growing and evolving fast — as it still is. Even when focusing on the heritage sector, there are several other repositories or planned systems that have a national vocation, within the archives or higher education communities for instance. Then came the matter of combining the needs of the library itself and the design necessities of third-party archiving to create a repository that would be scalable, trustworthy and open. Last but not least, the BnF is continuously refining the way the repository can best serve its clients. The most accessible function for partners is bit-level preservation, and any extra step toward comprehensive preservation has to be balanced with available resources and tiered prices. As the first clients come in, prices and processes are still in flux, and vulnerable to policy changes.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["digital repository. third-party archiving. cost models","lisbon"],"license":"CC BY-SA 2.0 AT","date":"2013-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2013"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:378014","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:378014/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

In digital memories, the idea of systematic forgetting has found little attention, so far. At first glance, forgetting seems to contradict the purpose of archival and preservation. However, we are currently facing a tremendous growth in volumes of digital content. Thus, it becomes ever more important to focus, while forgetting irrelevant details, redundancies and noise. This holds true for better organizing the information space as well as in preservation management for making and revisiting decisions on what to keep. Therefore, we propose the introduction of the concept of managed forgetting as part of a joint information management and preservation management process in digital memories. Managed forgetting models resource selection as a function of attention and significance dynamics. Based on dynamic, multidimensional information value assessment it identifies information objects, e.g., documents or images of decreasing importance and/or topicality and triggers forgetting actions. Those actions include a variety of options, namely, aggregation and summarization, revised search and ranking behavior, elimination of redundancy, and finally, also deletion. In this paper, we present our vision for managed forgetting, discuss the challenges as well as our first ideas for its introduction, and present a case study for its motivation.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["digital preservation; dynamic information value assessment; time-aware information access; managed forgetting; ipres; lisbon"],"license":"CC BY-SA 2.0 AT","date":"2013-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2013"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:378092","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:378092/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The purpose of the poster is to describe the novel framework for activity that was proposed in response to the EC FP7-ICT-2011-9 call, and to summarily describe some of the outputs and objectives in a graphical and accessible format.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["digital curation","costs","economics","benefits","sustainability","risk","4c","european commission","lisbon"],"license":"CC BY-SA 2.0 AT","date":"2013-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2013"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:377370","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:377370/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The web archive search user interface presented on this paper was derived from several rounds of development and usability testing over the Portuguese Web Archive search user interface (available at archive.pt). We present our findings gathered while adapting a typical web search user interface to the context of web archive search.  We describe how we adapted a typical search user interface to address full-text and URL search over web-archived data, highlighting the unexpected problems detected during us- ability testing of our interface and current limitations for future work. The obtained results from usability testing showed that the average user satisfaction with our user in- terface was 70%. The obtained results from anonymous user satisfaction questionnaires yield a 84.3% score. This paper presents results of an analysis of different implementations of the JPEG2000 standard, specifically part 1: JP2, an image format that is currently popular within the digital preservation community. In particular we are interested in the effect different JPEG2000 codecs (encoders and decoders) have on image quality in response to lossy compression. We focus on three main codec libraries for analysis - Kakadu, JasPer and OpenJPEG - migrating 932 TIFF newspaper images to lossy JPEG2000 files using 2:1 and 4:1 compression ratios, and monitor image quality using PSNR. We look at the combination of encoder/decoder pairs and find that using OpenJPEG for both gives the best quality results, albeit with the slowest execution time. We also find that in some circumstances, particularly when a JasPer encoder is used, in order to retain image quality of the decoded image, the best choice of decoder may not be the same codec used to create the JPEG2000; based on these results, the encoding library is therefore recommended technical preservation metadata to retain.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["jpeg2000","tiff","migration","codec","psnr","image quality","generational loss","lisbon"],"license":"CC BY-ND 2.0 AT","date":"2013-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2013"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:377377","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:377377/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Since then, it has periodically collected  live-web content to be preserved but also acquired historical web collections from third-parties previously published.  However, storing information before it vanishes from the web is not enough to make web archives useful to societies. Thus, the Portuguese Web Archive developed and made freely available several software tools to enable access to web-archived collections. The Portuguese Web Archive provides a full-text search service to access 1 131 million files archived from the web since 1996 (www.archive.pt).

Indeed the proper characterisation of phenomena, such as desertification, Arctic sea ice melting, volcanic activities or earthquakes effects, requires the analysis of data acquired in a long period and the validation of correctness of scientific models. This means that digital data, especially in the ES domain, represents an important asset to be preserved over time. Despite each single ES mission’s cost being quantified and supported by well documented evidence, ES organisations are not able to assess the value of data generated by those missions over time. This paper describes the rationale for and an approach to modelling the value of data/information to be preserved over long term in digital archive. This is the result of experience in the SCIDIP-ES project [16] which has considered the: i) definition of models for describing the value of digital data and related information; ii) characterisation of data/information value model through core set of key parameters and iii) identification of long term digital preservation activities that may potentially impact on key parameters and consequently on the value of digital assets. This model is being assessed in ES scenarios with data curators and archive managers.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["value of data/information","value model","sustainability","long term data preservation","earth science (es)","lisbon"],"license":"CC BY-SA 2.0 AT","date":"2013-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2013"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:378046","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:378046/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The justification of costs for the preservation is based on abstract risks such as the risk of losing cultural heritage information, or the risk of data deficien-cies for current and future research in big sets of data. Typically, the benefits from digitally preserving the objects of interest is difficult or impossible to quantify in terms of return-on-invest. In fact, it is common that memory institutions are mandated to pre-serve specific digital objects, making digital preservation not an option, but a legal obligation. While in the case of cultural herit-age and scientific research qualitative reasons for preservation suffice, enterprises have an additional obligation to quantify the expected benefits and expenses in order to determine the scope of information to be managed and take commercial decisions for or against digital preservation. To provide appropriate means for leveraging the benefits of digital preservation in a commercial context, we argue in this paper that enterprise risk managers are the established function to assess and support decisions about preservation in enterprises. We show that enterprise risk manage-ment can be linked to digital preservation and how intelligent enterprise risk management can be utilised to identify the need for digital preservation, determine the corresponding actions, and contribute to the overall commercial success of enterprises.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["digital preservation","intelligent enterprise risk management","commercial use of digital preservation","lisbon"],"license":"CC BY-SA 2.0 AT","date":"2013-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2013"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:378043","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:378043/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The work done on this was based on the hypothesis that preservability consists of a set of systems capabilities that originates from a combination of system/software capabilities as defined in ISO 25010:2010. Based on that hypothesis, it was verified that such quality characteristics influence the preservability of systems. That influence is relative, since it depends on the specific scenario being addressed and on the concerns and requirements of the stakeholders of the system, as different qualities of a system might assume different degrees of importance along time. With those principles taken into account, this work developed an assessment method for assessing the preservability of systems that can be adapted to each scenario being analyzed. For demonstrating the application of the method, an example assessment was performed on a specific scenario, which resulted on the revelation that preservability of the system in focus on that particular case can be greatly improved.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["trust","digital preservation","checklist assessment","lisbon"],"license":"CC BY-SA 2.0 AT","date":"2013-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2013"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:378050","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:378050/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

This occurs during the ingest of objects into the archiving system, specifically at the characterization stage when files are identified and validated. To ensure that the details of all embedded files are also recorded, nested archives are recursively unpacked and their contents characterized to identify all files in a package. Information about the embedded files is then stored as properties of the container object: this allows us to efficiently aggregate information about the contents of a container as queryable properties of the container.\nThis storage of the embedded file type information on the container object reduces the number of objects and properties which have to be queried to perform a preservation action, such as migration to a more recent file type. The database can be queried for a specific file type, and all files of that type, and archives containing files of that type will be returned without needing to query each embedded object individually.\nArchives containing files in need of preservation are temporarily unpacked and the files in need of transformation identified and migrated. Following the preservation action, the internal links within the archive are updated to maintain the integrity of the archive and the modified objects are re-ingested back into the system.\nThis approach results in minimal extra overhead at the ingest stage of preservation, but substantially reduces the number of entities which need to be queried to identify objects at risk when\nperforming preservation actions. In the case of large web archives, this may be several orders of magnitude, producing a corresponding increase in performance and scalability.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["scalability","web archiving","characterization","lisbon"],"license":"CC BY-SA 2.0 AT","date":"2013-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2013"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:378060","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:378060/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Five years later the production release of the software is ready to go into production at several major North American archives and libraries, while the beta version is already widely-deployed worldwide. In the absence of a single major funding sponsor, the project management team worked as third-party contractors to several early-implementer institutions that shared the project’s architectural and open-source vision while needing to implement an effective and sustainable digital curation solution for the digital content entrusted to their care. From the outset, Archivematica’s system requirements were based on an ongoing dialogue within the digital curation community about the gaps between the standards and strategies that were held up as best practice (OAIS, PREMIS, normalization, agile development and so forth) and the ability for the average archivists and librarians to implement them. The iPres conference has proven to be a critical forum for advancing this dialogue and has included papers about the Archivematica micro-services architecture [1] and community-driven development approach [2]. This paper will provide a conclusion to these earlier papers by discussing the key architectural, digital curation and sustainability challenges that the Archivematica project has addressed as it emerged from a working prototype to a full-featured digital preservation system. This includes system scalability, customization, digital repository interfaces, format policy implementation, and a business plan that stays true to the ideals of the free software community.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["archivematica","digital preservation","archives","oais","migration","formats","premis","mets","agile development","open-source","lisbon"],"license":"CC BY-SA 2.0 AT","date":"2013-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2013"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:378058","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:378058/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Cooperations to tackle this task are not a new idea - one of the first reports on digital preservation, commissioned by the Center for Preservation and Access (CPA) and the Research Library Group (RLG), recommended a \"national system of digital archives” [12]. In the library context consortia date back to the 1970s, where they rose in the context of shared cataloguing efforts. Over the years experiences have been gained in different forms of cooperations and consortia. Some are focused on a grouping of institutions based on institution type or regional factors, while others are more cross-sectional services, focused around factors like material type. The Leibniz Library Network for Research Information (Goportis) consists of the three German National Subject Libraries [19]. Goportis conducted a digital preservation pilot project between the years 2009-2011 and is now operating a collaboratively used central digital preservation system. The paper highlights the lessons learned from experiences in the collaborative approach to digital preservation, focusing on the influence the factors \"geographical location\", \"organization type\" and \"collection\" have on a shared system implementation and operation. Based on a literature study of international best practices, guidelines and recommendations a thesis will be formulated for each of the three factors, which will then be checked against the experience gained by the Goportis consortium.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["library network","cooperative conducted digital archive","consortial digital preservation","lisbon"],"license":"CC BY-SA 2.0 AT","date":"2013-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2013"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:377394","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:377394/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

To achieve this ability, knowledge about aspects of the world that might hinder the preservation of content is needed. However, the processes of gathering, managing and reasoning on knowledge can become manually infeasible when the volume and heterogeneity of content increases, multiplying the aspects to monitor. Automation of these processes is possible [11, 21], but its usefulness is limited by the data it is able to gather. Up to now, automatic digital preservation processes have been restricted to knowledge expressed in a machine understandable language, ignoring a plethora of data expressed in natural language, such as the DPC Technology Watch Reports, which could greatly contribute to the completeness and freshness of data about aspects of the world related to digital preservation. This paper presents a real case scenario from the National Library of the Netherlands, where the monitoring of publishers and journals is needed. This knowledge is mostly represented in natural language on Web sites of the publishers and, therefore, is difficult to automatically monitor. In this paper, we demonstrate how we use information extraction technologies to find and extract machine readable information on publishers and journals for ingestion into automatic digital preservation watch tools. We show that the results of automatic semantic extraction are a good complement to existing knowledge bases on publishers [9, 20], finding newer and more complete data. We demonstrate the viability of the approach as an alternative or auxiliary method for automatically gathering information on preservation risks in digital content.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["digital preservation","monitoring","watch","natural language","information extraction","lisbon"],"license":"CC BY-SA 2.0 AT","date":"2013-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2013"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:377390","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:377390/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

As an important part of our cultural heritage they need to be collected and preserved for current and future generations of researchers. In the analogue world we have established criteria for selection, standardized technologies and well defined responsibilities for preservation. In the digital world, responsibilities, technology and selection have to be redefined and established. There is an urgent need to do this, because digital objects have a limited shelf life and the risk of loss is therefore imminent. This is especially true for the preservation of the great number of freely floating objects in the World Wide Web. But the mere storage of digital content is not even enough. A true preservation strategy also needs to ensure the long term accessibility to and usage of the stored objects. It is this combination of long term storage and long term usability that defines a \"trusted digital repository\".\nDeveloping the right technology and establishing the adequate organisational structure is not an easy task, but setting up criteria of selection might even be harder. We need answers to the question what documents researchers need today and what they will need tomorrow or in the far future. We need the right guidelines for selection or valuable resources will have disappeared tomorrow.\nBecause of the high-speed, high-price, high-risk issues of digital preservation, it can only be addressed in a cooperative way. What is needed is a coordinated web of trusted digital repositories with preservation policies that guarantee long term archiving as much as long term usability.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["göttingen"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2005-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2005"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:295031","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:295031/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Compared to the fonts, colors, point sizes, and graphics available in contemporary formats, plain text may look dull and dry, but in fact this \"desiccated data\" successfully represents all the protocols that built the Internet.\nMoreover, it is hard to imagine its not being nominated as the most likely current format to be readable 30 years from now. A proposed strategy for preserving today's web formats is to go ahead and save the original format, but also to automatically derive and save various \"desiccated\" versions that, while failing to capture all the original format's richness, nonetheless capture its essential nutrient value. In the case of a document, saving a plain text format version alongside the original would provide a fall back in case the original format failed. One never knows if there will ever be money enough to touch a preserved object again, let alone migrate its format. The effort and storage for a derived plain text version is often needed anyway to support search indexing.\nGeneralizing, the lesson appears to be that the simpler technological intermediation required to render the digital object for the user, the easier it is to reproduce that intermediation, hence to carry forward the object. Along these lines, the image format analog of plain text file might be a basic raster file, in which the array of pixels (picture elements) could be seen to mimic ancient weaving technology. It may be that adding the complication of a simple run-length encoding compression would be worth the space savings. A strategy for deriving and saving raster images of original documents rendered with today's software has two advantages: we will never have better rendering tools for today's formats than today (with all the features and error-compensation that make malformed format instances -- very common -- renderable) and it provides an additional fall back in case the original and the plain text fail. This is something we can do for preservation today that we may never have the money or the knowledge to do in the future.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["göttingen"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2005-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2005"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:295039","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:295039/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

This evolutionary shift significantly changes the task profile of libraries and especially concerns archive libraries, which are entrusted with the preservation of a nation's cultural heritage. As libraries expand their scope to accommodate digital objects, they can no longer resort to established methods for archiving print, but must adapt their organisation and operation to meet a completely new set of requirements.\nThese new requirements are spelled out within the framework of Information Lifecycle Management (ILM), which is used in industry and commerce as a standard model for such analysis. This analysis also enables Die Deutsche Bibliothek's present situation to be mapped out in a generalized manner. ILM boils down to a strategic model for actively managing the storage and retrieval of digital objects throughout their entire life cycle. Which guidelines, methods and instruments are best suited to provide a cost-effective and mission-adequate infrastructure for archived data and their accessory applications?\nDie Deutsche Bibliothek is currently leading the cooperative development of a deposit system for digital resources (kopal: Co-operative Development of a Long-Term Digital Information Archive), which will be presented as a background for discussing key aspects of these requirements and their consequences for systems implementation.

The amount of information presents a challenge, but it is neither the only, nor the most limiting one given the continuous drop in storage device costs. Significant challenges lie in the management and technical issues of the location and collection of web sites. They will be briefly presented.\nBecause of this, archiving the web is a task that no single institution can fulfil alone. It requires a collaborative effort in which there is a natural division of roles in space (breadth and depth of the information space) as well as a potential functional division of tasks. But working collaboratively in this domain entails a methodological clarification as well as the definition of common standards & tools in a domain where traditional preservation practices have been unprecedented challenged. Progress in this domain will be presented, mainly carried out by the International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC) a consortium of 12 national libraries and the Internet Archive.\nWeb archiving requires also the mastering of complex processes in an extremely diverse and continuously changing technological environment.

The idea was to use a common format for different media types (text, image, audio and video streams), which is very flexible to support different document models and allows the usage of several metadata formats. The \"Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard\" (METS) is a container format to describe digital documents. Derived from early metadata description formats as used in \"Making of America\", it provides a flexible container format not only for digitized printed material but also for other digital media as audio and video streams. A METS-file keeps all information about the document's associated objects together - including structural data, metadata and contentfiles. Though METS allows the description of complex objects, METS files can be very simple. The only required object is a structural map which may provide optional links to metadata- and fileobjects.\nThe first METS files were used for presentation purposes of digitized material using XSLTs to create a TOC from the structural map and to implement simple page turner-software to browse image by image through the book (METS file contains metadata about the images and provides a link to the TIFF or JPEG file). As documents are getting more complex and the requirements to store the content are changing, more and more institutions are using document management systems (DMS) to implement repositories. A DMS provides additional and improved functionalities for retrieval, management of content files, template engines, administration toolkits etc. This functionality becomes available for METS files as well, as more and more DMS support METS as their Submission Information Package (SIP).\nPreserving content for a long time is still a technical challenge, which requires specialized systems. These systems are not only responsible to preserve the bitstreams, but also for storing all necessary administrative data, which might be useful for future migration etc. These systems are usually compliant with the OAIS model using SIPs and DIPs for ingesting and exporting data from the archive. METS as a standarized container format is a good choice to import/export data to/from OAIS compliant systems. Preservations metadata as defined by PREMIS fits into the administrative metadata section of a METS document. Currently the preservation requirements are driving the ongoing development of METS. For version 1.5 of the METS schema an extension is discussed to allow pointing into file-archives as tar and zip to e.g. attach metadata (and other associated objects) to embedded files.

Dale"],"abstract":"PREservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies working group, or PREMIS, has been an activity jointly sponsored by OCLC and RLG, focusing on issues associated with implementing preservation metadata in digital archiving systems. It was established to develop a common, implementable core set of metadata elements for digital preservation, since most published specifications for preservation-related metadata are either implementation-specific or broadly theoretical. Comprised of nearly 30 international experts representing national and university libraries, museums, archives, government agencies, and the private sector, PREMIS was charged to define a set of semantic units that are implementation-independent, practically-oriented, and likely to be needed by most preservation repositories as well as to identify and evaluate alternative strategies for encoding, storing, managing, and exchanging the core elements within a digital archiving system.\nAs part of the PREMIS work, existing preservation repositories were surveyed about their architectural models and metadata practices. The result, documented in the report Implementing Preservation Repositories for Digital Materials: Current Practice and Emerging Trends in the Cultural Heritage Community, summarized survey responses which addressed the mission, policy, economic, and technical aspects of digital repositories, as well as current practices for creating, managing, and maintaining preservation metadata within the repository environment. Analysis of the survey responses suggests that the digital preservation community is beginning to coalesce around several emerging trends and best practices in the use and management of preservation metadata.\nIn May 2005, the PREMIS working group released its final deliverable: the final report. The semantic units that support long term preservation are represented in a data dictionary with implementation details and in METS-compatible XML schemas. Examples of the metadata elements applied against a range of digital objects are also a component of the report. A glossary of terms and concepts, a data model, and a typology of relationships developed during the course of the work further supplements PREMIS’s contributions to the cultural heritage community. The presentation will discuss the work of PREMIS, the resulting reports and preservation metadata tools, as well as the ongoing PREMIS maintenance activities.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["göttingen"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2005-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2005"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:295043","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:295043/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

In order to provide full access to the underlying information content of digital objects, the fundamental characterization property is format. Without proper format typing all digital content is opaque. Format typing permits the interpretation, rendering, and processing of encoded digital content necessary to fulfill the preservation mandate to provide access to stored digital content over time. Major format dependencies can be identified in many of the workflows defined by the OAIS repository reference model. Fortunately, a new generation of format-aware tools and evolving sets of best practices are now becoming available for use by preservation managers. However, in many instances the range of formats that a digital repository is expected to support will exceed the local format expertise of that repository's preservation staff. This fact, coupled with the long time-scales over which an understanding of formats must be maintained, underscores the importance of establishing sustainable public registries of format representation information.\nThis presentation will review the format dependencies found in preservation workflows, survey recent developments in the area of format-aware tools, best practices, and registries, and will conclude with two cases studies of preservation-driven format migrations.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["göttingen"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2005-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2005"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:295042","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:295042/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Although the field is rapidly maturing, it still lacks a comprehensive competency profile for practitioners. This is due in part to the relative youth of the field, and to the fact that being an effective steward of digital materials requires highly specialized training that is best acquired through hands-on work. Given the key role that competency profiles play in the design of curricula and job postings, the lack of one hinders the training and education of professionals for these positions. This paper provides a profile of the skills, responsibilities, and knowledge areas that define competency in digital stewardship, based on a close study of the projects undertaken in the National Digital Stewardship Residency program (NDSR). The authors use a triangulated research methodology in order to define the scope of the profile, qualitatively analyze the competencies articulated among NDSR project descriptions, and quantitatively evaluate those competencies’ importance to professional success. The profile that results from this research has implications for current and future digital stewards: training designed with this profile as its basis will focus on the skills most needed to be an effective digital steward, and therefore can guide both graduate and professional development curricula alike.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":null,"license":"CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2016-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2016"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:503088","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:503088/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Although the digital (r)evolution has reshaped our lives dramatically in the last decades, our digital heritage, and especially the digital memory of the early web, is at risk of being lost. Or worse already gone. Time for the Amsterdam Museum and partners to act and start to safeguard our digital heritage. But, how to excavate The Digital City, a virtual Atlantis, and reconstruct it into a virtual Pompeii? In the case study of web archaeology we will try to answer the questions: how to excavate, reconstruct, present, preserve and sustainably store born-digital heritage and make it accessible to the future generations?","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":null,"license":"CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2016-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2016"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:503160","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:503160/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

We examine at a practical level what is involved in migrating to or from a cloud-hosted service, either to bring preservation in-house or to move to another service provider. Using work by Arkivum on providing Archivematica as a hosted service, we present how an organisation can use such a hosted service with assurance that they can exit without loss of data or preservation capability. Contractual agreements, data escrow, open source software licensing, use of independent third-party providers, and tested processes and procedures all come into play. These are necessary to mitigate the risks of a wide range of scenarios including vendor failure, service unavailability, change in customer preservation scale or budgets, and migration to or from an in-house approach. There is an existing body of work on how to trust and measure a service that a vendor might offer, for example using audit criteria for Trusted Digital Repositories or measuring service maturity using NDSA preservation levels. However, there has been far less work on how to quickly and safely exit providers of such services - despite this being an essential part of business continuity and disaster recovery. This poster presents some of the considerations and the practical approach taken by Arkivum to this problem including: use of open source software (Archivematica, and ownCloud), data escrow, contracts and handovers, use of vendor independent standards and interfaces (PREMIS, METS, Bagit) and technical migration support, e.g. exports of databases, configurations, software versions and updates. We believe the experience and approach that we have developed will be of use to others when considering either the construction or the use of cloud preservation services.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":null,"license":"CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2016-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2016"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:503165","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:503165/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

This is mostly due to the complexity caused by the variety of data to be managed and a lack of easily standardiseable procedures in highly diverse research settings. Yet, as even domains in this long tail of research data are increasingly data-driven, scientists need efficient means to precisely communicate, which version and subset of data was used in a particular study to enable reproducibility and comparability of result and foster data re-use. This paper presents three implementations of systems supporting such data identification services for comma separated value (CSV) files, a dominant format for data exchange in these settings. The implementations are based on the recommendations of the Working Group on Dynamic Data Citation of the Research Data Alliance (RDA). They provide implicit change tracking of all data modifications, while precise subsets are identified via the respective subsetting process. These enhances reproducibility of experiments and allows efficient sharing of specific subsets of data even in highly dynamic data settings.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":null,"license":"CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2016-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2016"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:502904","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:502904/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

We compress 503 files with two software utilities – ImageMagick and LibTiff – and record the resulting file size for comparison against the original uncompressed version. Overall we find that in order to effectively (although not necessarily optimally) reduce total storage, Group 4 compression is most appropriate for 1-bit/pixel images, and ZIP compression is suited to all others. We also find that ImageMagick – which uses the LibTiff library – typically out-performs LibTiff with respect to compressed file sizes, noting that this appears to be the result of setting the “Predictor” tag.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":null,"license":"CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2016-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2016"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:503166","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:503166/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

This workshop seeks to discuss ways in which cultural heritage institutions such as libraries, archives, and museums, along with university researchers, and software and systems developers in this domain, can help individuals and groups come to grips with their digital collections and preserve content that is important to their lives, organizations, communities, and heritage in trustworthy, long-term ways. Very few initiatives are on-going worldwide on this topic, one of the most relevant, the PDA conference in the US, is presented to bring the discussion to Europe. Cultural heritage organizations that are building trustworthy digital repositories along with tool builders and software/system developers have much to offer in this arena but roles and responsibilities as well as incentives and resources must be established.

Web referencing is highly relevant and crucial for various research fields, since an increasing number of references point to resources that only exist on the web. However, present practices using URL and date reference cannot be regarded as persistent due to the volatile nature of the Internet, - and present practices for references to web archives only refer to archive URLs which depends on the web archives access implementations. A major part of the suggested adjustments is a new web reference standard for archived web references (called wPID), which is a supplement to the current practices. The purpose of the standard is to support general, global, sustainable, humanly readable and technology agnostic persistent web references that are not sufficiently covered by existing practices. Furthermore, it can support better practices for precise references in spite of the temporality issues for web material as well as issues related to closed web archives. In order to explain needed change of practices based on the wPID, the paper includes a thorough description of the challenges in web references.

Webrecorder introduces a new web archiving concept, symmetrical archiving, which makes use of actual browsers and actual user behavior to archive the web, as well. The software stack used for accessing or replaying archived material is exactly the same as during the capturing process. This allows for unprecedented fidelity in web archiving, , enabling the preservation of items embedded complex, dynamic web applications, while keeping their whole, interactive context as well as any user specific content.

Data are normally stored in specific formats for documents, images, sound, video, etc., produced by software from different vendors. This software is controlled neither by the institution producing the files, nor by the institution that archives it. This obligates memory institutions to carry out conformance tests before accepting transfers of electronic collections, but again these are beyond the control of the institution and can be unreliable. This poses problems for long-term preservation. Digital content, meant for preservation, passing through an uncontrolled generative process can jeopardise the preservation process. The objective of PREFORMA (PREservation FORMAts for culture information/e-archives) – a Pre Commercial Procurement project co-funded by the European Commission under its FP7-ICT Programme – is to give memory institutions full control of the conformance testing of files created, migrated and ingested into archives. This is achieved through the development of open source tools which enable this process within an iteration that is under the full control of memory institutions. The project aims to establish a sustainable ecosystem involving interested stakeholders from a variety of backgrounds, including researchers, developers and memory institutions. The workshop will present the results of the project, including demonstration of the conformance checkers developed during the prototyping phase. This will inform a discussion with the digital preservation community – open source community, developers, standardization bodies and memory institutions – about the opportunities offered by PREFORMA and the challenges that are still to be addressed.","full_text":null,"type":"workshop","categories":null,"keywords":null,"license":"CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2016-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2016"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:502813","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:502813/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

As opposed to long-term digital preservation procedures, which are set about afterwards when relevant digital objects have already been identified, this process starts shortly after physical material (computers, hard drives, disks…) is delivered to the archive and has been ingested and safeguarded into volume image files. In this situation, it is important to get an overview of the “current state”: Which data was delivered (amount, formats, duplicates, versions)? What is the legal status of the stored data? Which digital objects are relevant and should be accessible for which types of users/researchers etc.? What kind of contextual knowledge needs to be preserved for the future? In order to address these questions and to assign meaning to both technological and documentation needs, the digital analysis tool “Indexer”1 was developed [3]. It combines automated, information retrieval routines with human interaction features, thereby completing the necessary toolset for processing unstructured digital estates. It turns out however, that intellectual work and deep knowledge of the collection context still play an important role and must work hand in hand with the new automation efforts.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":null,"license":"CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2016-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2016"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:502853","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:502853/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

These transitions have enabled the system to become not only less dependent on interpretation by middleware, but also easier to transfer to new storage components. Additionally, the need for specialized software knowledge is alleviated; any Linux systems administrator should be able to install, configure, and run the software services with minimal guidance.

The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) policy framework is particularly significant, as it sets a timeframe for institutions to develop and implement a roadmap for research data management.\nThe UK Digital Curation Centre (DCC) is responding to such changes by supporting universities to develop their capacity and capability for research data management. This paper describes an ‘institutional engagement’ programme, identifying our approach, and providing examples of work undertaken with UK universities to develop and implement RDM services. We are working with twenty-one HEIs over an eighteen month period, across a range of institution types, with a balance in research strengths and geographic spread.

Such basic metadata is seen as essential in all digital preservation systems, how- ever has been overlooked to a large extent when publishing linked data.

The preservation of complete processes, including the supporting infrastructure, raises a number of new challenges. In highly computerized firms, processes are often based on service oriented architectures with services provided by third parties. Digital preservation of business processes requires keeping the data, software services and infrastructure available for long time spans. The strong intra- and interdependencies of components make modification and adoption for preservation highly complex. Besides the technical challenges, the organisation and legal aspects of a process need to be considered as well.

In recognition of this fact and encouraged by growing interest from its affiliates, the Florida Digital Archive (FDA) conducted an evaluation of several of the PDF to PDF/A converter applications, the result of which is reported in this paper. There is room for interpretation in the ISO standards concerning PDF/A, which can be manifest in the development of software. In selecting a PDF to PDF/A converter product, reliability of the outcome in terms of PDF/A compliance must be established along with functionality.

Renewed dialogue with producers and users has led to the addition of functions the digital preservation team would not have thought of.

{"title":"Will Formal Preservation Models Require Relative Identity? An exploration of data identity statements","url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/ipres/ipres-2012/papers/will-formal-preservation-models-require-relative-identity-an-exp/","creators":["Simone Sacchi","Karen M. Wickett","Allen H. Renear"],"abstract":"The problem of identifying and re–identifying data put the notion of of ”same data” at the very heart of preservation, integration and interoperability, and many other fundamental data curation activities. However, it is also a profoundly challenging notion because the concept of data itself clearly lacks a precise and univocal definition. When science is con- ducted in small communicating groups, with homogeneous data these ambiguities seldom create problems and solutions can be negotiated in casual real-time conversations. However when the data is heterogeneous in encoding, con- tent and management practices, these problems can produce costly inefficiencies and lost opportunities. We consider here the relative identity view which apparently provides the most natural interpretation of common identity statements about digitally–encoded data. We show how this view conflicts with the curatorial and management practice of “data” objects, in terms of their modeling, and common knowledge representation strategies.\n\nIn what follows we focus on a single class of identity statements about digitally–encoded data: “same data but in a different format”. As a representative example of the use of this kind of statements consider the dataset “Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) Data Center Closings 2010-2013”1 , available at Data.gov.

Retrocomputing includes many activities that can be seen as constituting “preservation,” and in particular digital preservation. At the same time, however, it is often transformative, producing assemblages that “remix” fragments from the past with newer elements or joining historic components that were never previously combined. While such “remix” may seem to undermine preservation, it allows for fragments of computing history to be reintegrated into a living, ongoing practice, contributing to preservation in a broader sense. The seemingly unorganized nature of retrocomputing assemblages also provides space for alternative “situated knowledges” and histories of computing, which can be quite sophisticated. Recognizing such alternative epistemologies in turn paves the way for alternative approaches to preservation. The institutional digital preservation community may have a lot to gain from paying closer attention to retrocomputing. This gain, however, should not just involve looking for ways to make use of the knowledge and labor of retrocomputing enthusiasts. Rather, it is important to recognize the value of their projects on their own terms and ask in what ways institutional efforts can support such projects.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["ischool","toronto","canada","retrocomputing","software preservation","remix"],"license":"CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2012-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2012"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294080","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:294080/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Methods for assessment of digital preservation compliance inside an organization have been introduced, such as the Trustworthy Repositories Audit & Certification: Criteria and Checklist. However, these methods are oriented towards repository-based scenarios and are not geared at assessing the real digital preservation capabilities of organizations whose information management processes are not compatible with the usage of a repository-based solution. In this paper we propose a checklist assessment method for digital preservation derived from a capability-based reference architecture for digital preservation. Based on the detailed description of digital preservation capabilities provided in the reference architecture, it becomes possible to assess concrete scenarios for the existence of capabilities using a checklist. We discuss the application of the method in two institutional scenarios dealing with the preservation of e-Science data, where clear gaps where identified concerning the logical preservation of data. The checklist assessment method proved to be a valuable tool for raising awareness of the digital preservation issues in those organizations.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["ischool","toronto","canada","repository audit and certification","trust","digital preservation","reference architecture","checklist assessment"],"license":"CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2012-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2012"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:293865","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:293865/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

In order to assess the authenticity and the provenance of the records, one must be able to trace back, along the whole extent of their lifecycle since their creation, all the relevant events and transformations they have undergone and that may have affected their authenticity and provenance and collect the Preservation Description Information (PDI) as categorized by OAIS. This paper presents a model and a set of operational guidelines to collect and manage the authenticity evidence to properly document these transformations, that have been developed within the APARSEN project, a EU funded NoE, as an implementation of the InterPARES conceptual framework and of the CASPAR methodology. Moreover we discuss the implementation of the guidelines in a medical environment, the health care preservation repository in Vicenza Italy, where digital resources have a quite complex lifecycle including several changes of custody, aggregations and format migrations.

However RDF/S schemas or ontologies are not static, but evolve. This evolution usually happens independently of the “metadata” (ontological instance descriptions) which are stored in the various Metadata Repositories (MRs) or Knowledge Bases (KBs). Nevertheless,\nit is a common practice for a MR/KB to periodically update its ontologies to their latest versions by “migrating” the available instance descriptions to the latest ontology versions. Such migrations incur gaps regarding the specificity of the migrated metadata, i.e. inability to distinguish those descriptions that should be reexamined (for possible specialization as consequence of the migration) from those for which no reexamination is justified. Consequently, there is a need for principles, techniques, and tools for managing the uncertainty incurred by such migrations, specifically techniques for (a) identifying automatically the descriptions that are candidate for specialization, (b) computing, ranking and recommending possible specializations, and (c) flexible interactive techniques for updating the available descriptions (and their candidate specializations), after the user (curator of the repository) accepts/rejects such recommendations. This problem is especially important for curated knowledge bases which have increased quality requirements (as in e-Science).

This is basically identical to the situation of evaluating the performance in an emulation setting.\nIn this paper we show how previous conceptual work is applied to an existing emulator, allowing us to feed automated input to the emulation environment as well as extract properties about the rendering process. We identify various significant key characteristics that help us evaluate deviations in the emulator’s internal timing compared to the original system and how we can find out if the emulation environment works deterministically, an important characteristic that is necessary for successful comparison of renderings. We show the results of rendering different digital objects in the emulator and interpret them for the rendering process, showing weaknesses in the evaluated emulator and provide possible corrections as well as generalized recommendations for developing emulators for digital preservation.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["ischool","toronto","canada","emulation","digital preservation"],"license":"CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2012-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2012"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:293842","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:293842/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

In contrast to migration, an emulation approach requires a number of additional components, namely the full software-stack required to render a digital object, and its configuration. Thus, independent of which emulator is chosen, contextual information of the original computer environment is always needed.\nTo overcome this knowledge gap, a formalization process is required to identify the actual building blocks for an authentic rendering environment of a given object. While the information gathering workflow relies heavily on user knowledge and manual interaction during ingest, the workflow is coupled with a feedback loop so that both a complete emulation environment and preservation of desired properties for later access are ensured.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["ischool","toronto","canada","emulation","digital preservation"],"license":"CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2012-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2012"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:293838","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:293838/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

But digital information objects are in the deep sense of the word much more fragile than traditional paper based information. They can be easily altered, damaged or become unreadable especially in the long run of time. In this situation a special deposit system is necessary, which supports procedures to preserve electronic publications (online and offline) and keeps them accessible through time. To implement such a system, specific standards, technologies, and procedures are needed.\nThe basic standard of a Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System – OAIS describes the situation in principal. The OAIS generic model consists of functional entities with well-defined interfaces and introduces a concept of packages to standardize and interconnect preservable content and metadata.\nWithin this model the building block \"Archival Storage\" is responsible for keeping intact the bitstream of the digital object's preservation master. It may either be the original bitstream or the result of one of several migration procedures in the archive life cycle of the digital object.

Seen from the author's or the user's perspective, however, those attributes are sufficient to ensure permanent access to the electronic publication? The usual experience with the Internet promises not a sufficient result: URLs don't offer a mechanism that allows internet based publications to be identified unequivocally and being traceable at anytime. One solution to that situation is being provided by Persistent Identifiers such as Uniform Resource Names (URN), whose implementation Die Deutsche Bibliothek consolidates within the scope of the project EPICUR.\nAn implementation in local contexts cannot provide the persistency of that addressing scheme on its own. For example, if an institution ceases the maintenance and provision of a digital collection, their references – even when applied by a persistent adressing scheme – would equally be volatile as in case of URLs. To ensure a long-term usability of a permanent addressing scheme such as URN, it is necessary tocreate an infrastructure with an institutional backup.\nThe talk focusses on a general description of the Persistent Identifier activities worldwide and on productive implementations.

It is now a 10-year old project with collections ranging from 1996 to the present. To ensure their long-term preservation, the choice has been made to ingest these web archives into the institution’s existing digital preservation repository, SPAR (Scalable Preservation and Archiving Repository). There were numerous implementation challenges, on the modeling as well as the technical sides, which the library met with solutions drawn from international collaboration and widely adopted standards, whenever possible.\n– Web archive-specific formats (W/ARC files) lacked validation and characterization tools, which led to the development of a Jhove2 module for the ARC format.\n– The heterogeneity of BnF’s web archives in terms of formats, production workflows and tools, was managed by aligning all of them on a single model, the current production workflow using NetarchiveSuite.\n– The specificities of web archives were matched to the PREMIS data model and dictionary and SPAR’s global METS profile.\n– Finally, the need to express technical information about ARC files in a concise, manageable fashion led us to define a format-specific metadata scheme for container files, containerMD, which will be released to the preservation community (on BnF’s website).\nAll this development work means new services for digital curators in general and preservation experts in particular. They will be able to know their collection better, to check its comprehensiveness, and, with that deeper understanding, to investigate new preservation strategies.

Jackson","Jodie Double","Bo Middleton"],"abstract":"Manual quality assurance (QA) of digitised content is typically fallible and can result in collections that are marred by a variety of quality and access issues. Poor storage conditions, technology obsolescence and other unforeseen problems can also leave digital objects in an unusable state. Detecting, identifying and ultimately fixing these issues typically requires costly and time consuming manual processes. An inadequate understanding of potential tools and their application creates a barrier to the automation and embedding of preservation processes for many collection owners. The JISC funded [1] Automating Quality Assurance Project (AQuA) [2] applied a variety of existing tools in order to automatically detect quality and preservation issues in digital collections and work to bridge the divide between technical and collection management expertise. Two AQuA Mashup events brought together digital preservation practitioners, collection curators and technical experts to present problematic digital collections, articulate requirements for their assessment, and then apply tools to automate the detection and identification of the content issues. By breaking down the barriers between technical and non-technical practitioners, the events enabled grass-roots digital preservation collaboration between the two communities. This paper describes the AQuA Project’s novel approach to agile preservation problem solving and discusses the incidental benefits and community building that this strategy facilitated.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["singapore"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2011-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2011"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294255","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:294255/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

We construct a database from administrative records containing information about thousands of social science studies that have been conducted over the last 40 years. Included in the database are descriptions of social science data collections funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. Using a subset of these awards, we conduct a survey of principal investigators (n=1,021). We find that very few social science data collections are preserved and disseminated by an archive or institutional repository. Informal sharing of data in the social sciences is much more common. The main analysis examines publication metrics that can be tied to the research data collected with NSF and NIH funding – total publications, primary publications (including PI), and secondary publications (nonresearch team). Multivariate models of the count of publications suggest that data sharing, especially sharing data through an archive, is associated with many more times the publications compared to not sharing data. This finding is robust even when the models are adjusted for PI characteristics, grant award features, and institutional characteristics.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["singapore","research data sharing","scientific productivity","digital preservation"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2011-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2011"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294251","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:294251/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The aim is to increase knowledge of the problems related to recordkeeping in this kind of environment. Two police operations have been used as data sources, one large EU ministerial meeting in Sweden, and one regional disaster training exercise. An interpretative case study approach has been applied where observation and interviews were the primary data collection techniques. One problem is that too much important information is recorded in less permanent ways, on whiteboards and on flip charts.

When operating at very large scale there is also a real need for a large network bandwidth and high speed storage systems.\nBy minimizing the need for human interaction and employing software parallelization our initial findings indicate that the primary bottleneck is not processor bound, but is directly associated with the movement of digital files into and within the application.

The goal of the Virtual Archiving for Public Opinion Polls: A Demonstration Project aims to streamline the ingest process and increase timely submission to data archives. Bridging this gap between producers and archives will increase the overall submission rates and ultimately preserve many data sets that would otherwise be lost.\nAround the world researchers and scientists collect vast amounts of data, which often are not archived after the completion of the project or task. As researchers move on to new projects, past data they have collected are seldom documented and preserved [6]. Until the tools for data curation are integrated into the research lifecycle of data, we will continue to experience this problem [2]. This project seeks to provide a solution for this problem. Although the virtual archiving technology needed to bridge the gap between the data producers and archives already exists, the availability of this tool and its value needs to be communicated to the scholarly community.\nThe technology we use for this demonstration can be applied to many disciplines and data types. In this demonstration, we use public opinion data producers because these data serve as a useful, readily recognized example that will be widely replicated. Public opinion survey data are the most prevalent single kind of social science data and usually what most scientists first encounter.\nThe Odum Institute’s relationship with the various state polling agencies and the National Network of State Polls make it an ideal candidate to propose new and innovative changes in the data life cycle of public opinion polls. This projects builds on our previous work with the Dataverse Network (DVN), developed at Harvard University. The Odum Institute has been an active partner in the DVN development and has recommended system modifications to allow for the maximum flexibility in public opinion preservation, distribution, and analysis. The DVN provides the tools necessary to implement this change. In this project, we use the DVN technology to aid data producing agencies in the ingest, curation and preservation of public opinion data, election polls and reports.\nAutomated ingest tools specifically designed for quantitative data are used to create metadata automatically on ingest. This is critical for two reasons. First, metadata are essential in making data accessible to the scholarly community beyond those who were involved in the data collection. Second, the creation of metadata — itself a technical field with its own set of tools and norms — is a specialty that lies beyond the expertise of most research teams. \nThe project is creating customized Web interfaces or “virtual archives” for each of the participating data producers. These interfaces are created to allow the researchers to seamlessly upload their data. The data will be transparently archived, preserved and curated by an organization trained in the field of long-term preservation.

Understanding the effect of different policy decisions, such as when to migrate or whether to stay within a format family or branching into several format families turns into a complex task, specifically when considering non-trivial ingest structures and assumptions on format evaluations.

The Planets preservation planning approach and the tool Plato have received considerable takeup and produce a growing body of knowledge on preservation decisions. However, experience sharing is currently complicated by the inherent lack of semantics in criteria specification and a lack of tool support. Furthermore, the impact of decision criteria and criteria sets on the overall planning decision is often hard to judge, and it is unclear what effect a change in the objective evidence underlying an evaluation would have on the final decisions. This article presents a quantitative approach and tool to support the systematic assessment of criteria and their impact in preservation planning.

Several communities, like biology, medicine, engineering or physics, manage large amounts of scientific information, including large datasets of structured data that matters to preserve, so that it can be used in future research. To achieve long-term digital preservation, it is required to store digital objects  reliably, preventing data loss. The data redundancy strategy is required to be able to successfully preserve data. Many of the characteristics required to implement, manage and evolve a preservation environment are already present in existing data grid systems, such as replication and the possibility to federate with other grids in order to share resources. We propose the customization of a data grid platform in order to be able to take advantage of its replication and federation features. In that way, scenarios where federated grids not thought for preservation purposes can be extended to preservation and their spare resources used with that mission.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["singapore","data grids","digital preservation","redundancy","federations","replication"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2011-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2011"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294216","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:294216/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The year 2004 saw the creation of a new preservation standard into which it was decided to migrate the above mentioned archival holdings. The main objectives of this operation were to save data from technological obsolescence and to reduce the cost of both access and future migrations by streamlining the collection. The project costs approximately 30 FSCs (one ‘FSC’— Format and Structure Conversion—is the way the project’s project management measured 1 person-year, and equals 1,291 person-hours). The total sum of purchasing software, hardware and external services amounted to around 135.000 Euros.\nThe project migrated data from both relational and hierarchical databases (for instance ERDMS and registries), and included the digitisation of audio, video as well as paper documentation. The registries counted for example the first Civil Registration System from 1968 and the State Tax Administration's final equation from 1970. Data and documentation made up a total of about 1.7 TB, consisted of 11,187 files scattered in almost 200 different structures, and constituted more than 2,000 information packages (IPs).\nThe overall technical objective of the migration was defined by the aforementioned preservation standard, which required:\n• Common format for data files\n• Common structure of  documentation, metadata and documents\n• Common format for documents (TIFF).\nThe project's main objectives were achieved, since all records were migrated, except the film collection. The goal of making access and future migrations easier was also reached, but a fully automatic migration of the collection is not yet entirely possible. The overall conclusion is that the migration project, which, to our knowledge, is the first of its kind, was of very high quality, both in terms of planning, execution and product. A few main conclusions are:\n• Standardisation of data is a prerequisite for an economically sound digital preservation: It took about 70 times longer to migrate an older, non-standardised IP, than a newer, standardised one.\n• Inadequate feasibility studies remind us that the timing in digital preservation saves money: The condition of the magnetic tapes was examined through spot checking 10 years prior to the migration project and found satisfactory, which turned out to be an erroneous, expensive conclusion.\n• The technical infrastructure suffered from a number of shortcomings and late decisions, resulting in precious loss of time.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["singapore","migration","evaluation","database"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2011-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2011"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294205","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:294205/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

It provides a simple to use methodology that considers the individual characteristics of different settings. The cost model provided detailed formulas to calculate the expenses. The model supports the detailed calculation of the expenses for the near future and helps to identify the cost trend in the medium and long run (e.g. 5, 10 or 20 years) of the archive. The model monetary assesses the user’s work, the purchases of storage hardware and other costs of preserving a digital collection. In this paper the first version of the model is presented.

Currently, in this project, we address the preservation of relational databases by focusing on the conceptual model of the database, considering the database semantics as an portant preservation \"property\".

To provide this service, CINES deployed in 2006 one of the first digital repository in France named PAC (Plateforme d’Archivage du CINES – the CINES preservation system).\nIn order to secure this mandate in the long-term, it is absolutely crucial for CINES to prove the quality of the services it provides to the French higher education and research community. For this purpose, the CINES strategy relies on the adoption of a quality assurance approach which includes the certification of its repository.\nOver the past four years, the PAC staff ran not less than five audits, internal as much as external. Various systems of reference have been used: some were at the national level (National Archives accreditation), others were at a European level (Data Seal of Approval accreditation, DRAMBORA) or even at an international level (ISO 16 363, TRAC).\nFrom these audits, the strengths and weaknesses of the digital preservation repository have been highlighted. Action plans have been put together and executed to improve the service quality. The aim of transparency, which ranked first in the certification initiative, also reinforced the trust of the user community toward the long term digital preservation service of the CINES. Based on such an experience, the PAC staff is now willing to share its knowledge and feedback with the rest of the community, by participating in think tanks as well as standardization workgroups.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["singapore","certification","audit","quality","trust","long-term preservation","archive","risk management","metrics and assessment"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2011-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2011"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294203","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:294203/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Furthermore, Law is becoming an essential application domain for technology developments. In case copyright protected data has to be digitally preserved, every process of a digital preservation system may violate this right, when the rightholder who has the exclusive rights did not grant the relevant rights of use. This paper shows a Legal Ontology that provides a hierarchical overview of how legal constraints and obligations (e.g. IP rights and licensing issues) could be implemented in an automated process of a DP system. In simply terms, difficulties with legal taxonomies may arises when the creators and the users don’t share the same perspective. This would be the case when the creators of the taxonomy are lawyers and the users not. Legal taxonomies for digital preservation can be represented with ontologies which are an explicit account of a shared understanding in any domain. Through the use of ontologies the communication can be improved, which, in turn, can give rise to greater reuse, sharing, transparency, and interoperability. Every DP activity must ensure the authenticity and legitimacy of the performed actions and processes. Hence to validate the correctness of our legal ontology we used a set of competency questions defined in a specific case study. The goal is to obtain a clearer taxonomical view of the necessary legal knowledge that will address the concerns of industrial use-case DP stakeholders. Therefore, we recommend using the Legal Ontology for the DP domain, in order to integrate different legal perspectives and perform reasoning and inference over legal knowledge and information.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["digital preservation","ontology","legal ontology","legal taxonomies"],"license":"CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2014-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2014"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:378715","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:378715/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Furthermore, Law is becoming an essential application domain for technology developments. In case copyright protected data has to be digitally preserved, every process of a digital preservation system may violate this right, when the rightholder who has the exclusive rights did not grant the relevant rights of use. This paper shows a Legal Ontology that provides a hierarchical overview of how legal constraints and obligations (e.g. IP rights and licensing issues) could be implemented in an automated process of a DP system. In simply terms, difficulties with legal taxonomies may arises when the creators and the users don’t share the same perspective. This would be the case when the creators of the taxonomy are lawyers and the users not. Legal taxonomies for digital preservation can be represented with ontologies which are an explicit account of a shared understanding in any domain. Through the use of ontologies the communication can be improved, which, in turn, can give rise to greater reuse, sharing, transparency, and interoperability. Every DP activity must ensure the authenticity and legitimacy of the performed actions and processes. Hence to validate the correctness of our legal ontology we used a set of competency questions defined in a specific case study. The goal is to obtain a clearer taxonomical view of the necessary legal knowledge that will address the concerns of industrial use-case DP stakeholders. Therefore, we recommend using the Legal Ontology for the DP domain, in order to integrate different legal perspectives and perform reasoning and inference over legal knowledge and information.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["digital preservation","ontology","legal ontology","legal taxonomies"],"license":"CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2014-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2014"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:378716","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:378716/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Such a framework with a high degree of generality emerges by treating DOs as containers of functional genetic information, exactly as in the genomes of organisms.

In molecular biology, genetic ablations (mutations) and environmental ablations (experimental manipulations) are used to construct interaction maps fully representing organismic activity. The equivalent of such interaction maps are dependency networks for the use of DOs within their Digital Environment (DE).

The creation and full exploitation of this valuable network of connections is currently hindered by the fragmentation and lack of coordination of the persistent identifier ecosystem. Several initiatives have emerged with the aim of offering global identifier repositories for digital and non-digital entities but they are still focused on the needs of specific communities and the lack of interoperability between them is one of the major hurdles for the development of a globally connected scholarly infrastructure. The aim of this paper is to propose a Persistent Identifier e-infrastructure (based on an identifier service called Entity Name System) which provides a technical layer of interoperability which allows current identifier systems to interoperate and be coordinated across geographical, temporal, disciplinary, organization and technological boundaries. The Persistent Identifier interoperability e-infrastructure is presented as a cross-cutting core service enabling the development of advanced added-value services tailored to the specific needs of different communities and stakeholders of the e-science environment.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["persistent identifer e-infrastructure","interoperability","e-science research infrastructures","entity name system"],"license":"CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2014-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2014"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:378107","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:378107/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

However, Perservica is unique in providing not just bit-level preservation but the full gamut of digital preservation services that, up until recently, were available only to organizations using a system installed on-site following on from a complex, and potentially risky, software development project. This “new paradigm” thus offers a zero capital cost “pay as you go” model to perform not just bit-level preservation but also “active preservation”. This short paper will describe the practical difficulties of providing and operating such a comprehensive\nservice in the cloud.\n\nA cloud system’s advantage is to reduce the need for capital costs (since hardware and software are rented not bought up front) and system maintenance (since this is provided by the system’s provider). To reduce costs further a system can share multiple organizations’ content on a single operational instance. However, this instance must maintain each such tenant organization’s isolation (i.e. one organization’s content must not be exposed to any others). In addition each tenancy must be able to control its own processes without being able to compromise those of other tenants. This leads to the need for some degree of tenancy administration (without placing on each tenant a large burden of administration that is best handled at the system level).\n\nThe need to move bulk content across the internet as part of ingest cannot be avoided but the remaining ingest functionality can be performed either prior to upload (through a downloadable client-side tool) or server-side (through comprehensive workflows). Some ingest streams (e.g., web crawling) in fact can be considerably eased by using the cloud since an organization’s local internet bandwidth is no longer relevant.\n\nOther OAIS functional entities (preservation planning, data management, administration and storage) can all be performed without the need to move content across the internet. Access can be provided in a variety of forms including those suitable for archivists and those suitable for the general public. It is also possible to render content server-side to minimize the need for download.\n\nImportantly, it is also possible to export an organization’s entire content thereby providing a suitable “end of life” route to move to a different digital preservation system.\n","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["oais","bit-level preservation","logical preservation","active preservation","cloud"],"license":"CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2014-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2014"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:378109","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:378109/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Recognizing the unique structural, operational, and collecting context of the British Library, the Library’s digital preservation team recently initiated new format assessment work to deliver recommendations on which file formats will best enable the preservation of integral, authentic representations of British Library collection content over the long term. This paper describes the work carried out to review previous assessments, identify appropriate sustainability categories and newly assess formats accordingly.\n\nWe posit that the relatively ‘fuzzy’ nature of a file format requires a relatively open-ended assessment framework and a nuanced understanding of preservation risk that does not solely lie with ‘all-or-nothing’ format obsolescence. We review other work in this area and suggest that whilst previous format assessment work has addressed a range of subtly different aims, experience has since indicated that some of the criteria used - such as considering number of pages in a format specification as a measure of complexity - may be invalid. British Library assessments are made on documented points of principle, for example, an emphasis on evidence-based preservation risks and the avoidance of numerical scores leading to comparisons between formats, and these have formed the base upon which sustainability categories are defined. We present these categories, which help to identify preservation risks or other challenges in the management of digital collections, and provide an overview of initial assessments of three formats: TIFF, JP2, and PDF. We acknowledge however, that implementation of preservation requirements, e.g., the use of particular preservation-justified file formats, must be balanced against other business requirements, such as storage costs and access needs, and argue that transparency of this format assessment process is fundamental if the resulting recommendations are to be fully understood in the future.\n ","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["british library","file formats","sustainability","assessments","transparency","preservation master"],"license":"CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2014-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2014"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:378110","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:378110/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

There have been a number of\ninitiatives to produce technical registries leading to the\ndevelopment of, for example, PRONOM, UDFR and the Planets\nCore Registry.\n\nHowever, these have all been subject to some criticisms. One\nproblem is that either the information model is fixed and difficult\nto evolve or flexible but hard for users to understand. However,\nthe main problem is the governance of the information in the\nregistry. This has often been restricted to the host organization,\nwhich may have limitations on the investment they can make.\nThis restriction has meant that, whilst other organizations have,\nperhaps, been free to use the registry they have been unable to\nadd to or edit the information within it. The hosts of the\nregistries have generally been receptive to requests for additions\nand change but this has still led to issues with timing or when\ndifferent organizations cannot agree (or just utilize or interpret\nthings in different ways).\n\nIn this paper we describe a new approach, which has used linked\ndata technology to create the Linked Data Registry (LDR). This\napproach means it is simple to extend the data model and to link\nto other sources that provide a more rounded description of an\nentity. In addition, every effort has been made to ensure there is\na simple user interface so that users can easily find and\nunderstand the information contained in the registry.\n\nThis paper describes what is believed to be the first linked data\ntechnical registry that can be deployed widely. The key element\nof the new approach is the distributed maintenance model which\nis designed to resolve the governance problem. Any organization hosting an LDR instance is free to add and edit content and to\nextend the model. If an instance of LDR is exposed on the\ninternet, then any other organization is free to retrieve this\nadditional information and hold it in its own LDR instance,\nalongside locally maintained information and information\nretrieved from other sources. This means a peer-to-peer network\nis established where each registry instance in the network\nchooses which other registry instances to trust and thereby from\nwhom to receive which content. This gives control to each\nindividual organization, since they are not dependent on anyone\nelse but can choose to take different content from appropriate\nauthoritative sources. At the same time it allows collaboration to\nreduce the administrative burden associated with the\nmaintenance of all of the information.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["linked data","digital preservation","automation","technical registries"],"license":"CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2014-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2014"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:378068","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:378068/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Comprehensive Preservation Planning depends on the availability of identified alternatives of preservation actions, which are for example file format migrations to migrate data in an outdated format to one that has better support. Also emulation, e.g. of the behaviour of a specific software application (application emulation), can be a viable preservation action. The alternative identification step can either be performed manually by an expert, or (semi-) automatically, if appropriate knowledge bases are available. Building and maintaining such knowledge bases is however a tedious task, as the number of software applications and file formats, and especially their relation to each other, is very large. In this paper, we therefore present an approach to automatically build knowledge bases for Preservation Planing from already existing, open resources. One such source is the community maintained Freebase, which contains linked data on many topics, among them file formats, software applications, and most importantly, their relations, in a structured manner. We demonstrate the applicability of these knowledge bases by automatically identifying possible digital preservative actions on a uses case, an eScience experiment from the domain of data mining. This use case originates from the task of process preservation, where we look beyond single files, but regard complete chains of executions as the objects to be preserved.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":null,"license":"CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2014-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2014"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:378078","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:378078/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

However, in order to ensure that this data is accessible in the long term, it is vital that we consider how to extract and preserve information on the software and hardware contexts which this data depends upon to operate. We therefore need tools to assist in identifying, preserving and validating the processes which underpin the creation of data in digital libraries. \n\nIn particular, we need to consider the importance of preserving not just individual digital artefacts, but the platforms which allow digital libraries to render or execute their items. Digital libraries rely on this software to render their items, and it is therefore important to know configuration details and software dependencies to ensure these items remain fully operational in the future. In the case of digital libraries, the TIMBUS framework provides the tools necessary to assist practitioners in identifying relevant processes, undertake risk analysis, and then to assist the user in extracting, preserving and revalidating the necessary processes.\n\nThis half-day tutorial introduces the TIMBUS approach to process preservation, and demonstrates how it can be applied to issues relating to digital libraries. TIMBUS focuses primarily on business processes, but this tutorial will show its approach to process-oriented preservation is also relevant to digital libraries. It provides a methodology for process preservation and a set of tools which help to semi-automatically validate and preserve processes so that they can be recreated at a later dat. Participants will be given the knowledge to understand the importance of technical environments for collection items, and learn more about the TIMBUS solutions through examples relevant to the digital library domain. They will also gain an understanding of digital preservation as a risk mitigation strategy. \n ","full_text":null,"type":"workshops and tutorials","categories":null,"keywords":null,"license":"CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2014-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2014"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:378687","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:378687/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

As such, it is\nincreasingly vital that organizations are able to judge the\neffectiveness of their investments into curation activities. For\nthose responsible for digital curation, it is an ongoing challenge to\nensure that the assets remain valuable in a sustainable manner.\nDigital curation and preservation practices are still evolving and\nthey are not well aligned across different organizations and\ndifferent sectors. The lack of clear definitions and standardization\nmakes it difficult to compare the costs and benefits of multiple\ncuration processes, which again impedes identification of good\npractice. This paper introduces a new perspective on modeling the\neconomics of curation. It describes a framework of interrelated\nmodels that represent different aspects of the economic lifecycle\nbased around curation. The framework includes a sustainability\nmodel, a cost and benefit model, a business model, and a cost\nmodel. The framework provides a common vocabulary and\nclarifies the roles and responsibilities of managers with a demand\nfor curation of digital assets and suppliers of curation services and\nsolutions. Further, the framework reflects the context in which\nmanagers operate and how this context influences their decision-making. This should enable managers to think through different\nscenarios around the economics of curation and to analyze the\nimpact of different decisions to support strategic planning. The\nframework is intended to serve as a basis for developing tools to\nhelp managers analyze the costs and benefits associated with\ncuration. The models are being developed and refined as part of\nthe EU project 4C “Collaboration to Clarify the Cost of Curation”,\nwhich is bringing together and bridging existing knowledge,\nmodels and tools to create a better understanding of the economics\nof curation.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["economics","models","curation","preservation","strategy","decision-making","costs","benefits","risks","sustainability."],"license":"CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2014-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2014"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:378069","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:378069/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

From the outset basic preservation procedures, like testing equipment, backing up hard-drives and assets or thoroughly documenting the hardware and software were put in place, but it was clear that these procedures would need revising over time and as our experience grew. Tate’s earliest softwarebased artwork was created in 2003 and after 10 years the issues around aging technologies are becoming more obvious and new strategies for preservation are more urgently needed. The number of artworks being acquired and displayed is increasing and therefore better workflows must be developed to accommodate this increase.\n\nThis paper describes a short project to scope the use of virtualisation for preserving software-based artworks in Tate’s Collection. It briefly explains the tests performed, in terms of the techniques, resources and expertise involved. Through the tests it was confirmed that virtualisation is a viable strategy for the preservation of software-based artworks, and that it meets our requirement that the artworks be stored as a complete system independent from the original hardware. It was also a main requirement that different virtualisation tools must support the resulting virtual machines.

In the PERICLES project we start by analysing how such information has been described in related work, considering common definitions of metadata, context, significant properties and environment, and we come to the conclusion that we need to consider the broadest set of information, which we term environment information. Building on previous deﬁnitions, we introduce the concept of Significant Environment Information (SE1) that takes into account the dependencies of the digital object on external information for speciﬁc purposes and significance weights that express the importance of such dependencies for the specific purpose. From there we expand the definition in time considering the importance of collecting SEI during any phase of the digital object lifecycle, following the sheer curation perspective. Examples of SEI are illustrated in the very diverse use cases considered in the project, that include diverse data types from the Art domain and data from space observations in the Science domain. Finally we introduce our PERICLES Extraction Tool, that we developed to capture SEI, and present methods to extract SEI with experimental results supporting the approach. The PET tool automates the novel techniques we describe, supports sheer curation, as a continuous transparent collection process that otherwise the user (e.g. scientist, artist in our use cases) would have to find time to perform manually.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["digital preservation","significant properties","significant environment information","environment information","dependency graph","sheer curation","significance weight","dependency extraction"],"license":"CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2014-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2014"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:378125","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:378125/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Most recently, the extension of legal deposit provisions to non-print works in 2013 has meant that the British Library - working in conjunction with the other UK legal deposit libraries - has begun to collect new categories of digital content, including periodic harvests of the UK Web domain. In order to support this, the Library has also invested heavily in developing scalable infrastructures for the acquisition, storage and management of large amounts of digital content. The British Library Digital Preservation Strategy, 2013-2016 is focused on the embedding of digital sustainability as an organizational principle across the Library and to help manage preservation risks and challenges across all digital collection content lifecycles.

The model is being standardised as the MPEG Multimedia Preservation Application Format (MPAF), addressing the specific issues related to the preservation description information of audiovisual contents. Several standards for expressing metadata in digital preservation are available and have been taken into consideration in the paper and in the work done in MPEG. However, none of them is able to cover all the needed aspects related to the preservation of audiovisual content. Audiovisual files are in most cases containers and are usually made up of several tracks carrying audio data, video data and specific time-based metadata. In order to be able to perform the opportune preservation actions (among others planning and format migration), several kinds of information must be kept alongside the audiovisual contents. Within this context a standardised representation for these structures and metadata is needed. Information such as quality description or fixity at frame level is required for ensuring long term access to visual content. Without using a standardised interface it is hard to guarantee a faithful rendering of encoded information while exchanging contents between different repositories, either internally or with external institutions. This paper describes the work done so far within MPEG for defining a standard metadata model which covers the identified missing parts and gaps regarding the acquisition of digital preservation description information.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["digital preservation","multimedia metadata","preservation description information","oais","audiovisual content preservation","standard"],"license":"CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2014-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2014"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:378108","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:378108/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

It is argued that the OO-IO model contributes a necessary extension to the literature of the digital preservation community to address the analysis and audit necessary for distributed digital preservation. \n","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["oais reference model","distributed digital preservation","standards","audits","analysis","collaboration"],"license":"CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2014-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2014"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:378118","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:378118/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Most scientific and engineering domains benefit from building on the outputs of other research by sharing information to reason over and data to incorporate in the modeling task at hand.\n\nThis raises the need for preserving and sharing entire eScience workflows and processes for later reuse. We need to define which information is to be collected, create means to preserve it and approaches to enable and validate the re-execution of a preserved process. This includes and goes beyond preserving the data used in the experiments, as the process underlying its creation and use is essential.\n\nThe TIMBUS project and Wf4Ever project team up for this halfday tutorial to provide an introduction to the problem domain and discuss solutions for the curation of eScience processes.

Unfortunately, over the decades the web has evolved beyond the reach of many of these crawlers, and today’s static crawlers fail to capture the look, feel, and functionality of a significant amount of interactive web content, including maps, visualizations, database-reliant projects and social media feeds. Archiving these dynamic websites requires a different approach, including a server- side web archiving option.\nReproZip-Web is an open source, grant-funded [1] web-archiving tool that can address this need. It builds on the high-fidelity crawling tools of Webrecorder by also encapsulating a dynamic web server software and its dependencies. The output is a self-contained, isolated, and preservation-ready bundle, an .rpz file, with all the information needed to replay a website, including the source code, the computational environment (e.g., the operating system, software libraries) and the files used by the app (e.g. data, static files). Its lightweight nature makes it ideal for distribution and preservation.\nThis interactive workshop will be particularly useful for web archivists, digital archivists, digital humanities scholars and others seeking to archive and preserve\ncomplex web projects. Attendees, who should be familiar with the command line interface, will practice packing and tracing a web application and recording the front-end of the site using ReproZip-Web. They will then be able to test replaying the site from the newly created and preservable .rpz file.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["dynamic web archiving","server-side web archiving","reprozip-web","webrecorder"],"license":"CC-BY 4.0 International","date":"2023-09-22T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2023"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://hdl.handle.net/2142/121052","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/items/128256/bitstreams/428877/data.pdf"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

While the DIP is a machine-readable format, it is not easily intelligible for the end user. In practice, making DIP truly accessible appears like a riddle. To make it more human-readable, a DIP must undergo some processing outside the repository and be converted in a new form, which should be discussed. These operations call into question the integrity of the archives, which was ensured until their delivery by the system. How, then, can archivists keep data trustworthy? Following recent requests for access, the Archives nationales (France) have provided some answers that could be used as a basis for discussion to solve this OeDIPus riddle. Their experience was one of moving from theory to practice, leading to the creation of an in-house proof-of-concept (POC) and tool: OE-DIP (Objets et Empreintes de DIP, Objects and Checksums of DIP).","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["access","dip","integrity","fixity","checksum"],"license":"CC-BY 4.0 International","date":"2023-09-22T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2023"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://hdl.handle.net/2142/121063","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/items/128267/bitstreams/428899/data.pdf"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}
{"title":"ESTABLISHING AN OPEN-SOURCE PACKAGE “ARCHIVE\"","url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/ipres/ipres-2023/papers/establishing-an-open-source-package-archive/","creators":["Euan Cochrane","Rafael Gieschke"],"abstract":"Many Linux-based operating systems use a package management system that enables users to install a wide range of applications using one or more simple workflows, without needing to find and download the applications from their original publishers. The package management systems also resolve dependencies for users by finding and installing any dependent-applications or “packages” that are needed in order to run the application that the user is trying to install.  These workflows greatly improve the experience of working with the operating systems and save a great deal of time for the end-users. When setting up the Emulation as a Service Infrastructure (EaaSI) platform to work with Linux-based operating systems we have encountered a number of issues when working with the operating systems’ built-in Package Management Systems (PKMS). The PKMSs usually include a list of servers that host the packages that the PKMS can install for the user. We have found that often those lists are out-of-date and point to servers that no longer exist. In some cases, it is impossible or nearly impossible to find alternative servers that are still actively serving the packages, and where they are available the speed/bandwidth is often much slower/limited for packages for older operating system versions than it was when the operating systems were current. Even when an alternative server can be found that is still actively serving the packages for a legacy operating system, the average end-user can often struggle to understand how to point the PKMS at a custom server as this often requires editing relatively obscure configuration files within the Operating System. \nTo address these issues the EaaSI program of work and Yale University Library have launched a spin-off project to create a central “archive”  of compiled, open-source software packages. The “archive” will host copies of packages for many versions of legacy operating systems and make them freely available to any users, whether working with EaaSI or using the legacy operating systems in other contexts. The archive is hosted directly on a public S3-compatible bucket without an additional frontend server to improve availability, reduce maintainability, allow for practically limitless scaling, and enable users to easily explore and clone its contents (or parts thereof). In addition, the EaaSI software is being updated to enable instance administrators to configure the platform to automatically re-route connections being made to the package servers configured as defaults in legacy Linux-based operating systems and dynamically and seamlessly re-map the connections to the appropriate locations in the new package “archive”. This is achieved either by automatically manipulating the DKMS’s configuration files or by transparently routing network requests to the originally configured domain to an emulated version of the DKMS’s server in a virtual network running in EaaSI.\nUnlike Software Heritage [1], the world’s preeminent archive of software source code, this project aims to primarily maintain an archive of compiled binaries and not the application source code. While there are some operating systems that use a PKMS that dynamically compiles from source code when installing applications, these are rare  and we are comfortable with the possibility of overlapping with the work of the software heritage team in this limited area. \nThere is a wide scope of future work for this project. In spite of being comfortable mildly overlapping on the work of the Software Heritage team, we are also interested in potentially creating reproducible builds of the packages in our “archive” within the EaaSI platform, using source code Sourced from Software Heritage. Doing the compilation from source within the EaaSI platform would provide an audit trail to further strengthen the trustworthiness of the packages provided in our “archive”.\nAnother future extension will be enabling sourcing packages from multiple sources, so that users can use one URL for any version of the same operating system, even if the packages were originally collected from different origin servers by our project. Here, a useful addition could be to seamlessly provide provenance information in S3 for individual packages, i.e., individual files in a directory sourced from multiple different origins.\nIn the regular use and development of repositories used by PKMSs the specific versions of the packages supplied by the repository are regularly updated and changed. IT is conceivable that users of our archive would need access to a specific version of a package, something that might not be possible if we only included the last version made available in the original repository. Therefore, a further (but much more elaborate) future extension could be to include different versions of the same package, a service offered for Debian at https://snapshot.debian.org/.\nFurther developments could include archiving the repositories of other package managers used in non-operating system contexts, e.g., PKMSs used for acquiring libraries for programming languages, for example., the Python Package Index (PyPI), Node.js’ npm, or various Docker registries (e.g., DockerHub, GitHub Container Registry). Here, a particular focus could be on providing time-travel functionality (as offered by snapshot.debian.org) as software projects often do not fully specify their required library versions (e.g., by only specifying a minimum version instead of an exact version) and do not work anymore when newer versions of their required libraries become available at a later time and are selected by the package manager. Here, a bigger focus would probably be on the integration into the system than on duplicating the archive.\n\nIn this poster, we will provide a visual overview of the plans outlined in this extended abstract and hope to use it to raise awareness of the “archive” in order to ensure extensive use of it once it is available.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["emulation","software preservation","open-source"],"license":"CC-BY 4.0 International","date":"2023-09-22T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2023"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://hdl.handle.net/2142/121064","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/items/128268/bitstreams/428901/data.pdf"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Provenance is more about the journey than the destination: this panel aims to surface a variety of experiences with provenance and to facilitate discussion and a community of practice around the relationship between digital preservation and provenance.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["provenance","authenticity","evidence","archival values","information theory"],"license":"CC-BY 4.0 International","date":"2023-09-22T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2023"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://hdl.handle.net/2142/121079","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/items/128283/bitstreams/428931/data.pdf"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Because of this, they might need to resort to campaigning for decision-making authority. Why is this? Memory institutions are used to adhering to standards and rules. Rules and regulations are beneficial for stability and trustworthiness. But too much focus on rules may create organizational rigidity which negatively impacts adaptability. Adaptability is a major goal for preservation so how could we create more room for this? An important part of adaptability is organizational learning. In order to facilitate learning we must understand which aspects of organizational practice negatively affect it. For example, avoiding discussion of mistakes is an important barrier to learning. If an organization prioritizes learning this can have a positive impact on the motivation of employees. Practitioners may feel more in control when they understand how to use theories of organizational learning to further implementation of preservation principles. More room for learning within the organization might also benefit the field of preservation itself through enhanced knowledge of what works and what doesn't.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["organizational theory","learning organization","adaptability","stability"],"license":"CC-BY 4.0 International","date":"2023-09-22T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2023"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://hdl.handle.net/2142/121088","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/items/128292/bitstreams/428949/data.pdf","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://hdl.handle.net/2142/121658"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

These techniques also contribute to the preservation of the trustworthiness of the records. In order to assess the situation of organizations in the implementation of their digital preservation activities, there is a need for an analysis tool. Many models have been prepared to meet this need. One is the Levels of Preservation (LoP) developed by the National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA). The LoP provides guidance to organizations in their digital preservation activities. Therefore, it is thought that the LoP can be associated with trustworthiness which aims at long-term preservation of the records. This study examines the levels of digital preservation specified in the LoP in terms of the trustworthiness of digital records. As a result of this research, the goal is to provide the basis for a methodology for organizations wishing to assess their level of digital preservation and to align their digital preservation capabilities with trustworthiness. This study used document analysis as a qualitative research design. Both field observations and research show that organizations are not sufficiently aware of the level of digital preservation and trustworthiness. Then, the question of the study is “how the levels that are specified in the LoP can be associated with the trustworthiness”. As a result of the study, it has been observed that the levels of digital preservation specified in the LoP can be used in the analysis of the trustworthiness of the records. It is expected that this study will raise awareness in the organizations to do a better job of preserving the records that have archival value.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["digital records","digital preservation","trustworthiness"],"license":"CC-BY 4.0 International","date":"2023-09-22T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2023"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://hdl.handle.net/2142/121089","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/items/128293/bitstreams/428951/data.pdf","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://hdl.handle.net/2142/121652"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Through a series of dedicated meetings, we formulated a strategy focused on preserving ongoing accessibility to our Flash objects through emulation. We were curious to find out if we had Flash objects, where they were located, and which solution would help us render these objects. This was done with the use of the three preservation functions (Watch, Action, and Planning).  After locating the Flash objects, we were able to test potential solutions.

This research is conducted through a comprehensive analysis of the extant literature and semi-structured interviews with administrative personnel employed in both public and private institutions in Oman. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten professionals in governmental organizations, who were chosen based on their expertise and experience in the field, using purposive sampling.\nThe findings showed that interviewees in Omani institutions value digital preservation for many reasons, such as compliance with Omani law on archives, improved organization and security, and ease of document access. However, all institutions have no unified application strategy for digital preservation. The findings revealed many challenges, including technological obsolescence, security risks, big data management, and human resource challenges.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["digital preservation","oman","institutional archives","information management","accessibility"],"license":"CC-BY 4.0 International","date":"2023-09-22T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2023"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://hdl.handle.net/2142/121098","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/items/128302/bitstreams/428969/data.pdf","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://hdl.handle.net/2142/121674"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

While artists, collectors, and crypto enthusiasts are jumping into this ecosystem, traditional collectors have found it more challenging to evaluate asset value in this NFT market than in the established collectible market. This paper navigates the reason for this problem by examining the design of NFT using ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards, then illustrates that NFT’s infrastructure makes its evaluation more challenging based on its unstable or lacking connection to the underlying digital assets, which makes the evaluation of NFT inconsistent. This paper will propose a revised business model with a workflow to add digital preservation to the NFT trading ecosystem.  The paper suggests adding digital preservation clients to the Ethereum blockchain and building communication with the back-end digital preservation system to guarantee the stability of NFT’s digital assets.

The Preservation Watch group researched on how institutions can monitor the life cycle of file formats in their repositories and how the monitoring could be implemented on a broader scale. Monitoring file format life cycle implies there needs to be a way to measure format obsolescence or helps an institution to identify when a file format is getting obsolete. The applied research identified the needed information and used a known model to search for trends and is applied in widespread areas. The model was compared with a naive method to evaluate the more complex method. This approach was tested in different types of repositories and used different file formats to research the robustness of the approach.

The DRI's usual depositors are academic, cultural heritage, or public organisations and libraries with a long history of archiving who select material from their own collections for preservation. Through the Community Archive Scheme, we work in a hands-on way to provide digital preservation to a wider range of groups that fall outside of this sphere. The scheme celebrates its fifth anniversary in 2023 and during this period DRI has worked with nine voluntary groups to help preserve material on a variety of topics including the experience of asylum seekers in Ireland, maternal health, built heritage, LGBT rights and activism in Ireland. The types of material that we are working to preserve through this scheme vary from photographs of artists' works such as quilts, audio-visual material such as community documentaries, and documentaries produced for digital radio and social media. This paper will discuss how the scheme evolved, how these organisations have strengthened DRI as an organisation as well as making our community and collections more equitable and diverse, challenges we have encountered, some of the solutions we have developed, where our successes have come from and some of the future developments we are exploring so that we can continue to work with these groups.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["digital archives","community archives","digital preservation","inclusion","membership","ireland","cultural heritage data"],"license":"CC-BY 4.0 International","date":"2023-09-22T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2023"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://hdl.handle.net/2142/121118","citation_pdf_url":"https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/items/128321/bitstreams/429007/data.pdf","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://hdl.handle.net/2142/121671"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

And yet, in the event of a disaster, it may be the very first thing we will turn to, to help to bring order to the chaos. When faced with lockdown as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020, there is some evidence that digital preservation practitioners turned to maintenance tasks like documentation when working from home [1].

The following\npaper discusses the importance of establishing this trust,\nretraces the development of TRAC as a reliable tool for\nevaluating trustworthy repositories, and details the\nprocess of the MetaArchive Cooperative’s application of\nTRAC to its distributed digital preservation solution.\nThis process revealed that the current metrics for\ngauging trust in digital preservation could be readily\napplied to distributed solutions with great effect.\nHowever, because these metrics often presume a more\ncentralized approach to preservation, the process also\nrevealed the need to apply them carefully and with great\nthought. To underscore this need, three organizational\nand technical comparisons are made between the\nMetaArchive’s distributed preservation activities and\nthe more centralized model assumed by TRAC and the\nOAIS Reference Model.

In addition to this so-called born-digital content, material that was produced to exist in an analogue form is now being digitised both for preservation and for easier access. This digital information comes in an ever greater variety of formats, many of which are relatively short-lived. Newer versions of the same software are often unable to render files produced with older versions of that software, let alone files produced with similar software from other vendors. Soft- and hardware environments change constantly and after only a few years can older files often no longer be rendered with up-to-date systems.\nWhile large scientific organisations and memory institutions (museums, libraries and archives) have in recent years invested significant effort and activity towards digital preservation, the commercial world does not currently have the means to preserve their digital information for the long term.\nThis paper sets out to determine what would be needed to make modern Enterprise Content Management (ECM) Systems ready for long-term preservation of the assets stored within them. For this aim both the general Model of an ECM and the “Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS)” have been described, and the special needs of an enterprise system identified.\nA special focus lies on the Electronic Records Management (ERM) component of ECMs, which already provides simple preservation functionalities, but lacks those aspects of the OAIS that would make it truly long-term preservation capable. A truly long-term preservation capable ERM would have to add these while retaining capabilities of compliance (the retention or destruction of certain documents in accordance to legal requirements).","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":null,"license":"CC BY-SA 2.0 AT","date":"2010-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2010"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:185501","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:185501/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Here we report the outcome of this work to date.\nThe sustainability efforts of Dryad are expected to provide a model that may be exported to other disciplines, informing the scale needed for a sustainable “small science” data repository and showing how to accommodate diverse business practices among scholarly publishers, funding agencies and research institutions.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":null,"license":"GPLv3","date":"2010-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2010"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:185233","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:185233/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

This area has become\nknown as preservation planning, and seeks to take\naccount of a wide variety of factors that might impact\npreservation decisions. Broadly there are two approaches\nto preservation planning. One provided in some digital\npreservation systems is to simplify and reduce both the\nnumber of file formats stored and therefore limit the number\nof preservation tools needed based on accepted recommendations.\nA more thorough, flexible and possibly\ncomplex approach, supported by the Plato preservation\nplanning tool developed by the Planets project, allows decisions\non preservation actions to combine analysis of the\ncharacteristics of different file formats with specific local\nrequirements, such as costs and resources.

It will investigate preservation strategies for digital objects from digitised paper material that must both be preserved and simultaneously retain a short route to dissemination. The investigation is based on a study of digitisation done a decade ago and digitisation done today. In the last decade mass digitisation has become more commonly used since technological evolution has made it cheaper and quicker. The paper explores whether there are parts of digital material digitised a decade ago worth preserving, or whether a re-digitisation via mass digitisation today can create a relevant alternative. The results presented show that the old digitised objects are worth preserving, although new digitisation can contribute additional information. A supplementary result is that investment in digitisation can mean lower costs in the long term. Manual adjustments for the image processing can result in considerably smaller images than images made in cheap mass digitisation. Although initial manual work is more expensive, the storage and bit preservation expenses are lower over a long period.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":null,"license":"CC BY-SA 2.0 AT","date":"2010-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2010"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:185514","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:185514/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

In July 2009, nestor transformed into a sustainable organization with 6 of the 7 project partners and 2 additional organizations entering into a consortium agreement. The preparation of the sustainable organization was a valuable experience for the project partners because vision and mission of the network were critically discussed and refined for the future organization.

The first explores the implications of the life-cycle of virtual worlds, especially of their extinction, for thinking about the history of computerbased technologies, as well as their use. The moment when a virtual world “is history” – when it shuts down – reminds us that every virtual world has a history. Histories of individual virtual worlds are inextricably bound up with the intellectual and cultural history of virtual world technologies and communities. The second sense of the virtual world as history brings us directly to issues of historical documentation, digital preservation and curation of virtual worlds.

The package will make it possible to transfer complex digital objects between dissimilar preservation repositories. For reasons of redundancy, succession planning and software migration, such repositories must be able to exchange copies of archival information packages with each other. Every different repository design, however, describes and structures its archival packages differently. Therefore each type produces dissemination packages that are rarely understandable or usable as submission packages by other repositories. The RXP is an answer to that mismatch. Other solutions for transferring packages between repositories focus either on transfers between repositories of the same type, such as DSpace-to-DSpace transfers, or on processes that translate a specific dissemination format into a specific submission package. Rather than build translators between many dissimilar repository types, the TIPR project has defined a standards-based package of metadata files that can act as an intermediary information package, the RXP, a lingua franca all repositories can read and write. In this paper we present the assumptions and principles underlying the TIPR concept of repository-to-repository exchange, and proceed to describe three aspects of the TIPR project: the RXP format itself; the tests we are conducting to prove and improve the use of the RXP; and finally, issues that have arisen in the course of the project so far.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["san francisco"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2009-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2009"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294006","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:294006/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The ongoing discussion on e-Infrastructure points out that we are still lacking reliable structures which support the expected integrated digital preservation infrastructure provided jointly by cultural heritage organizations, data centers and data producers. The slow development towards a global integrated digital preservation infrastructure in combination with adjacent pressing questions for the information infrastructure in general has led to an extended strategic discussion within the last years in Europe and the US: In studies, position papers and evaluation approaches we find elaborated building blocks for a roadmap and definitions for a more advanced landscape.

We are concerned with contemporary writers of belles-lettres (fiction, poetry, and drama), and the implications of the shift toward word processing and other forms of electronic text production for the future of the cultural record, in particular literary scholarship. The urgency of this topic is evidenced by the recent deaths of several high-profile authors, including David Foster Wallace and John Updike, both of whom are known to have left behind electronic records containing unpublished and incomplete work alongside of their more traditional manuscript materials. We argue that literary and other creatively-oriented originators offer unique challenges for the preservation enterprise, since the complete digital context for individual records is often of paramount importance—what Richard Ovenden, in a helpful phrase (in conversation) has termed “the digital materiality of digital culture.” We will therefore discuss preservation and access scenarios that account for the computer as a complete artifact and digital environment, drawing on examples from the born-digital materials in literary collections at Emory University, the Harry Ransom Center at The University of Texas at Austin, and the University of Maryland.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["san francisco"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2009-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2009"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294010","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:294010/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Smart migration concerns the conversion upon ingest of specific kinds of data formats, such as spreadsheets and databases, to an intermediate XML formatted file. It is assumed that the longterm curation of the XML files is much less problematic than the migration of binary source files and that the intermediate XML file can be converted in an efficient way to file formats that are common in the future. The features of the intermediate XML files are stored in the so-called SDFP schema (Standard Data Formats for Preservation). This XML schema can be considered as an umbrella as it contains existing formal descriptions of file formats developed by others. SDFP contains also a schemas developed by DANS, e.g. a schema for file oriented databases. It can be used e.g. for the binary \"DataPerfect\" format that was used on a large scale about twenty years ago and for which no existing XML schema could be found.

One of the fundamental design questions for digital repositories is how to break down the services and resources: who will have responsibility, where they will reside, and how they will interact. There is no single, optimal answer to this question. The most appropriate arrangement depends on many factors that vary across repository contexts and are very likely to change over time. This paper reports on our investigation and testing of various repository \"slicing and dicing\" scenarios, their potential benefits, and implications for implementation, administration, and service offerings. Vital considerations for each option (1) efficiencies of resource use, (2) management of dependencies across entities, and (3) the repository business model most appropriate to the participating organizations.

Investigations revealed that it is not sufficient to archive only the product design data which is created in early PLM phases, but preservation is needed for data that is produced during the entire product lifecycle including early and late phases. Data that is relevant for preservation consists of requirements analysis documents, design rationale, data that reflects experiences during product operation and also metadata like social collaboration context. In addition, also the engineering environment itself that contains specific versions of all tools and services is a candidate for preservation. This paper takes a closer look at engineering preservation use case scenarios as well as PLM characteristics and workflows that are relevant for long-term preservation. Resulting requirements for a long-term preservation system lead to an OAIS (Open Archival Information System) based system architecture and a proposed preservation service interface that respects the needs of the engineering industry.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["san francisco"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2009-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2009"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294018","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:294018/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF) has been working on the definition of digital preservation activities since 2003. This paper aims at presenting the organizational and human resources challenges that have been faced by the library in this context, and those that are still awaiting us. The library has been facing these challenges through a variety of actions at different levels: organizational changes, training sessions, dedicated working group and task forces, analysis of skills and processes, etc. The results of these actions provide insights on how a national library is going digital, and what is needed to reach this longstanding goal.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["san francisco"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2009-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2009"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294008","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:294008/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

One storage medium that was popular for home computers in the 1980s was the audio tape. The first home computer systems allowed the use of standard cassette players to record and replay data. Audio tapes are more durable than old home computers when properly stored. Devices playing this medium (i.e. tape recorders) can be found in working condition or can be repaired as they are made out of standard components. By re-engineering the format of the waveform the data on such media can then be extracted from a digitized audio stream. This work presents a case study of extracting data created on an early home computer system, the Philips G7400. Results show that with some error correction methods parts of the tapes are still readable, even without the original system. It also becomes clear, that it is easier to build solutions now when the original systems are still available.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["san francisco"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2009-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2009"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294011","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:294011/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Once accessible by such a tool, file-system data can be linked directly to Wikidata records and thus the breadth and depth of the Wikidata dataset. The combination opens up possibilities around the EaaSI work also being developed with Wikidata in mind. The Siegfried/Wikidata collaboration was an intentional one that would have been difficult to make happen through normal circumstances; be that geographic or organisational dispersal, opportunity, or cost. The project was seen as a worthwhile endeavour to pursue independently of these restrictions and other projects may in the future need to resort to non-traditional approaches to achieve their aim. The first iteration of this work successfully went live in October 2020 and for it to continue to succeed there is a call to arms from those in the digital preservation and Wikidata communities to help push it further.

However, during this conversion, a loss of information can occur. Certain functionalities cannot be translated to the new file format and therefore lose their meaning. An example of this are formulas. When converting towards an image-based file format, the outcome of the formula will still be displayed, but the calculation that is behind it is lost. It is therefore imperative to find out which properties in spreadsheets are significant, such that these can be preserved. The Open Preservation Foundation’s Archives Interest Group (OPF AIG) decided to research this using the InSPECT methodology, which consists of both an Object Analysis and a Stakeholder Analysis. These two types of analysis eventually led to a longer report which was published, in which not only our results were shared, but also a reusable and practice-tested method to apply the InSPECT methodology.

Based on the demands on long-term preservation of 3D data of cultural relics by museums, a solution of 3D digitization of cultural relics is proposed in this paper for the unbalanced cost-efficiency-result, rare data utilization and inconsistent data storage scheme in the process of digitization. To solve the problem of unbalanced cost-efficiency-result, an evaluation model of 3D digitization has been designed by the Palace Museum, namely comprehensive “cost-efficiency-result” evaluation model. By adding a QR code control device for close range photogrammetry of cultural relics the high digitization cost, low digitization efficiency and inconsistent data quality are solved. Based on the specific needs of preservation and utilization, different grades are specified for 3D data of cultural relics, and a three-layer hierarchical structure and storage scheme is designed in this paper, which solves data inconsistence and difficult data sharing. The above methods have been widely used in the digitization project of the Palace Museum, and the related studies and practices also provide reference for the further development of national 3D digitization standards.\n","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["museum","cultural relics","3d data","photogrammetry","accuracy control"],"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2021-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2021","institutions":"[\"The Palace Museum\", \"China Ordnance Industry Survey and Geotechnical Institute\"]"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:1424917","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:1424917/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

This edition will be officially launched during the 2nd Memory of the World Global Policy Forum to be held in Paris on 21-22 September 2021. \nThis one-hour workshop would be geared to an audience of practitioners of digital preservation.  The workshop would introduce the Guidelines, elaborate on key points made in the Guidelines, and provide opportunity to exchange questions and answers. The workshop would be informal, allowing for active interchange among the workshop participants and the workshop leader.\nII.\tOBJECTIVE\nThe workshop’s objective is to provide guidance and advice to participants about the appropriate digital resources that should be preserved by cultural and memory institutions for long-term access. \nIII.\tBACKGROUND AND RELEVANCE \nThe origin of these Guidelines was the very successful UNESCO Memory of the World conference held in 2012 in Vancouver Canada gathering over 600 global participants from cultural institutions, governments and the information industry to discuss digital information, its safekeeping, and continued access to these digital resources [link]. One of the conclusions of the conference was that there was a lack of information and guidance on what digital items should be kept for posterity, given the fact that the volume of digital information was almost incalculable. And since 2012, that number has multiplied many times over. Some selection of digital resources would be needed in order to keep the task manageable.\nTherefore, a Content Task Force, consisting of members from UNESCO, The International Council on Archives (ICA) and led by IFLA was created to develop guidelines to assist practitioners and decision makers in making informed decisions about what digital resources should/must be kept for long term access.\nThe result was the publication “Guidelines for the selection of digital heritage for long-term access” which was launched in 2016 and widely used for training and advocacy purposes around the world.\nFive years is a long time in the digital ecosystem, and it was felt necessary to bring the Guidelines up to date, especially to add some of the newer forms of digital resources widely available. ICA, The International Council of Museums (ICOM) and IFLA representatives as well as other experts worked for the past 18 months, in a virtual way, to develop the second edition of the Guidelines. This publication will be officially launched in September 2021.\nTherefore, the timing is perfect to bring this publication to the attention of practitioners and decision makers dealing with the challenges of preserving digital information at this iPres conference. This workshop would fit under Sub-theme 4: Building the Capacity.\n","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["content selection","digital preservation","libraries","archives","museums"],"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2021-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2021","institutions":"[\"IFLA)\", \"University of British Columbia / IFLA\"]"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:1424918","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:1424918/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

It also makes new integrations possible for projects, which are based on data harvested from COPTR.\n\nCOPTR Edit-A-Thon during iPRES2021 invites the international digital preservation community to come together in a common effort to enrich the data in COPTR, explore the possibilities of the recently added semantic annotation, and discuss the future of the registry. It will combine hands-on editing, group discussions, and brainstorms conducted in a hybrid manner. With this edit-a-thon we aim to develop new/improved entries, new ideas for making the most of the new functionality, and new items to add to the “to do” list for future improvements.

However, this has been difficult to achieve within current data and software preservation practice due to data dependence on specialty software which becomes unusable as a result of rapid obsolescence of hardware and operating systems.  This paper introduces a novel Executable Archive framework that extends traditional data archives with a platform for hosting legacy software and with processes for installing, use, and long-term maintenance of the software. Through a case study of a scientific software de-commissioning, we demonstrate the use of the framework for designing a solution for GLP-compliant software transition from operational to archival use and a secure processing of raw archived data to reconstruct past research studies. The framework is flexible and opens up opportunities for preservation planning and action that consider both data access and software management together, ensuring that the archived data integrity is fully supported by the long-term software integrity.\n","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["data integrity","software integrity","study reconstruction","significant properties","executable archive"],"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2021-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2021","institutions":"[\"Intact Digital Ltd\", \"University of Hertfordshire\"]"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:1424943","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:1424943/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

This paper presents a software solution developed by Arkivum to meet the needs of long-term digital preservation of scientific datasets in ARCHIVER.  We present and discuss how this solution is scalable (able to process and store very large volumes of research data) and sustainable (both economically and environmentally). This is achieved through a combination of serverless computing, deployment on hyperscale infrastructure, and implementation of configurable ‘Minimum Effort Ingest’ workflows.  In particular, we show how high-performance and scalable Long Term Digital Preservation (LTDP) of very-large datasets can be done in a way that is entirely compatible with high levels of cost-efficiency and minimized environmental impact.\n","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["scalability","sustainability","environment","cost","research data"],"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2021-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2021","institutions":"[\"Arkivum\"]"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:1424914","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:1424914/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Since the web at its core consists of HTTP requests and responses, this process is often done at the HTTP traffic level to ensure full fidelity.\n\nTraditionally, as pioneered by the Internet Archive and others, capture has been done by a web crawler which would automatically ‘crawl’ sites by making HTTP requests and discovering new links.\n\nAnother approach is to capture content through the web browser itself, capturing content right before it gets to the browser (or even right after). This type of web archiving can be done by using the suite of open source tools to capture interactive websites and replay them at a later time as accurately as possible on one’s own computer. \n\nWebrecorder project builds tools that specialize in a ‘user-driven’ form of web archiving, where the user is able to direct the archiving process through their browser. The goal of Webrecorder has been to build quality open source tools to enable ‘web archiving for all’ to allow anyone with a browser to create their own web archives, and to accurately replay them at a later time.\n\nWebrecorder project intends to support the creation of lots of small, decentralized archives by individuals and institutions. Rather than supporting a single centralized silo, a key goal remains to support web archives in a variety of environment and storage scenarios. From users’ personal laptops, to google drive, to IPFS, Webrecorder tools will be designed to support creating and accessing web archives wherever they may be found.\n\nThrough this workshop participants will gain a working knowledge on how web archiving works by using a simple web archiving process from capture to replay on a user’s local computer by using two open-source tools from Webrecorder: archiveweb.page and replayweb.page. \n\nArchiveweb.page is an open-source web archiving capture tool that turns your browser into a full-featured interactive web archiving system. It is available as an extension for any Chrome or Chromium based browsers and as a standalone app. \n\nReplayweb.page is an open-source browser-based viewer that loads web archive files provided by the user and renders them for replay in the browser. It functions as a serverless (client-side) web archive replay tool.\n\nBoth these tools combined create high-fidelity web archives using a basic workflow from capture to replay that participants can control, save, and embed onto other platforms. All the code can be viewed and accessed via the Webrecorder github: http://github.com/webrecorder/\n\nAttendees will benefit from this workshop by gaining the ability to create high fidelity captures to make collections that they’ll have full autonomy over and can manage on their own devices and services. This session includes step-by-step installation help for both archiveweb.page and replayweb.page from the Webrecorder team. There will be a tutorial on how to analyze the website before capturing pages as well as breakdown to better understand components of the practice of web archiving and explore how they can fit into existing and emerging digital preservation workflows.\n\nThe target audience members for this type of workshop include: researchers, archivists, librarians, other practitioners working with digital materials, and developers. No prior experience with web archiving will be required of attendees.\n","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["web archiving","capture","replay","open-source tools","web collecting","personal digital archiving","high fidelity web archives","managing web archives","skills building","hands-on workshop"],"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2021-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2021","institutions":"[\"webrecorder\"]"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:1424942","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:1424942/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Anyone who works with software understands that applications come and go, and even those that last many years go through numerous upgrades and re-architectures as they try to keep up with the latest technological advances. This flux creates a problem: how do we efficiently move our data through changing software and version upgrades as losslessly as possible? The Fedora community recently confronted this problem, which led to the development of a tool that could have broad utility for data migrations.\nFedora is a flexible, extensible, open source repository platform for managing, preserving, and providing access to digital content. Fedora has gone through several major version upgrades since its initial conception almost 20 years ago, most recently with the move to Fedora 4. Fedora 4 is a complete software re-architecture, which necessitates a data migration from previous versions of Fedora. This experience led the Fedora community to focus on making it as easy as possible to get data into and out of Fedora in standard formats, an effort that culminated in the creation of an import/export utility that standardizes on RDF and the BagIt specification to transfer data between versions of Fedora as well as external preservation systems. This effort coincides with a recently chartered Research Data Alliance working group with a mandate to explore technologies and standards for interoperability between repository platforms and make recommendations on this topic. The group is exploring the Fedora import/export utility as a possible basis for broader interoperability between diverse repository platforms by building on this standard import/export functionality. This paper will provide an overview of the import/export efforts that have taken place so far, and discuss how we might achieve broader interoperability and ease data migrations through the work of the RDA Research Data Repository Interoperability working group.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["kyoto"],"license":"CC BY-SA 4.0 International","date":"2017-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2017"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:931092","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:931092/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Augmented Reality Games (ARGs) present challenges unique to the technologies implemented within them, blending the physical world with the virtual world, the socializing factors embedded in play, and the increasingly network-distributed nature of their content. We examine two popular ARGs, Ingress and Pokémon GO, as case studies and illustrate the additional challenges ARGs bring to preserving video games. Boundaries in ARGs question the traditional understanding of gameplay, while preserving changes in virtual and physical space present challenges to ARG representativeness and authenticity. Metaplay illustrates behavior based on non-deterministic situations, often as a result of real world changes. We also review different approaches suggested in prior literature for preserving video games, focusing on preserving the context and history of the game by collecting relevant artifacts and documentation, and explain why implementing these approaches could be challenging for ARGs.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["kyoto"],"license":"CC BY-SA 4.0 International","date":"2017-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2017"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:931107","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:931107/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

These jobs have been usually performed by persons with special knowledge. In this paper, the authors propose a semi-automated method to convert natural texts in real bibliographic data into Linked Data. As a part of the method, a simple ontology of key elements (named entities) in bibliographic data is constructed along general bibliographic rules for historical heritage. The ontology also has a capability to describe relations between a book and its parts. This allows mechanical access to information such as a creator of a cover picture, preface and so on. Finally, a script creates connections from named entities to URIs which describe headings or glossaries provided online by public organizations.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["kyoto"],"license":"CC BY-SA 4.0 International","date":"2017-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2017"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:931094","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:931094/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

PIDs are long- lasting references to objects and offer a solution for link rot, which often results in 404 or Not Found error messages.\nCultural heritage organisations, regardless of size, are often hesitant to implement PIDs in their systems. They lack knowledge of PIDs, are unaware of the capabilities and benefits of PIDs, and fear possible complex and costly implementation processes as well as the maintenance costs for sustained services.\nTo address these issues, the DHN PID project focussed on:\n Raising awareness of (the importance of) PIDs in cultural heritage organisations,\n Increasing knowledge regarding the use of PIDs within cultural heritage,\n Supporting the technical implementation of PIDs in cultural heritage collection management systems.\nAt the time of writing, four vendors have implemented PIDs in the collection management systems (CMS) they provide1, and a dozen cultural heritage institutions are taking part in this pilot implementation phase. More importantly however, is that through these CMS vendors, PIDs have become more available and affordable as a sustainable long term access solution for hundreds of institutional digital collections and their users. To ensure that the information, training and education the project provided about PIDs can be disseminated and used as widely as possible, the project created (best practice) documentation in Dutch and English, along with a unique PID Guide for learning about PIDs and taking the first steps towards selecting a suitable PID solution, along with a PID implementation Roadmap. This was an effort to encourage the adoption and use of PIDs in the cultural heritage domain, by utilising their existing collection management system vendors.\nThe concept of ‘cutting in the middle-man’ – cooperating with collection management system vendors and supporting the implementation of PIDs in their products – has proven extremely successful, and the outcomes of this project may help cultural heritage initiatives in other countries to get PIDs implemented in their organisations too.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["kyoto"],"license":"CC BY-SA 4.0 International","date":"2017-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2017"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:931104","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:931104/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}
{"title":"Metadata-Driven Approach for Keeping Interpretability of Digital Objects through Formal Provenance Description","url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/ipres/ipres-2017/papers/metadata-driven-approach-for-keeping-interpretability-of-digital/","creators":["Chunqiu Li","Shigeo Sugimoto"],"abstract":"Metadata about digital objects help users find, understand, use and reuse those objects. Longevity of digital objects is a vital issue for digital preservation, which means that the metadata about digital objects must be maintained as well, so that their content and meaning should be maintained over time. Open Archival Information System (OAIS) defines three metadata components, which have to be maintained with Digital Object – Representation Information of Digital Object, Preservation Description Information (PDI) in an Information Package, and the Content Information given to every Information Package. Provenance of a digital object, which is one of the five categories of PDI, is a crucial record of the history of the object over its lifecycle. Since metadata are exchanged as digital objects on the Web, machine-readable and interoperable provenance description of metadata is required for the long- term maintenance of metadata. This paper presents issues in the longevity of metadata, especially the issue of metadata provenance based on the Singapore Framework for Dublin Core Application Profiles (DCAP), which is well known for metadata interoperability in the networked information environment. The paper first briefly discusses features of metadata as first class objects on the Web. Then, we address potential risks in affecting interpretability of digital objects and issues in the consistent maintenance of metadata. Next, the W3C PROV standard for general provenance description and Resource Description Framework (RDF) for metadata exchange on the Web are adopted as the base models for provenance description of metadata. We developed simple provenance description models for formal provenance description for both structural features and vocabularies of metadata. The models are designed based on Entities and Activities defined by the W3C PROV in correspondence with primitive changes of metadata application profiles and metadata vocabularies, respectively. We also provide formal provenance description examples corresponding to structural changes in a metadata application profile along with semantic changes in the use of its metadata vocabulary. We discuss limitations of our proposed models and review provenance related research. Finally, the main findings of this research are summarized in the conclusions.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["kyoto"],"license":"CC BY-SA 4.0 International","date":"2017-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2017"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:931067","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:931067/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

There are many existing open-source natural language processing (NLP) tools that can identify and report on named entities, and projects in the digital humanities have previously demonstrated the scholarly value of NLP approaches when working with digitized materials. To date, there has been relatively little adoption of NLP tools for the analysis of born-digital materials by libraries, archives and museums (LAMs). There are a variety of challenges associated with applying NLP tools to born-digital primary source collections, including those forensically acquired from removable media. Many of the challenges relate to the diversity of materials and potential use cases.

These include the works of famous or important authors, artists, politicians, and musicians, some of which are stored on digital media dating back 30 years or more. Many digital objects have escaped the blight of bit rot, and legacy hardware, though rare, is still available for reading the media. Assembling the required equipment and expertise is possible but increasingly difficult.\nThis is an ongoing challenge which is not confined to floppy disks or obsolete hard drives. The challenge is exacerbated by the reality that many artefacts are not considered for preservation until the creator has passed away. In addition to the past 30 years’ worth of media, today’s storage media will also soon be superseded with newer technology and form a new challenge for future archivists. In order to preserve the content, or the look and feel of the original objects, precautionary actions must be taken which require both knowledge and the right equipment.\nCreating disk images from obsolete magnetic media is not a sim- ple task, especially when it concerns more obscure or older formats such as 8-inch disks. There are many challenges to overcome, with each small success leading to a new phase of discovery.\nIn this case study we recount our progress, through many stages, of dealing with the described challenges with regards to a set of 8-inch magnetic floppy disk media. At the beginning of this project, most requirements for recovering the data from this media were unknown: the original hardware system, the original operating system, and the disk format. In this paper, we describe our approach to uncovering this information, leading to a successful preliminary outcome. This is a cautionary tale which aims to provide some lessons for use in related contexts.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["kyoto"],"license":"CC BY-SA 4.0 International","date":"2017-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2017"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:931070","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:931070/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

One common example is that replicas of preservation copies of digital objects need to be independently preserved (e.g., stored, managed, monitored, documented) to ensure that at least one correct replica will survive for as long as needed. Such independence can be achieved through distributed digital preservation that relies upon specific agreements between participating and contributing organizations. The OAIS Reference Model does not address the challenges of distributed digital preservation in detail, though it acknowledges the potential benefits and the options.\nA model in form of an extension to the OAIS Reference Model was developed by a Danish bit repository project, as there was an urgent need for such a model. This model has evolved to the Outer OAIS–Inner OAIS (OO-IO) Model through the international project “Framework for Applying the OAIS Reference Model to Distributed Digital Preservation”. Previous papers have presented the theoretical basis for the OO-IO model as a model to describe distributed digital preservation systems in a way that conforms to the OAIS Reference Model, but practical examples of applying the model have been sparse.\nThis paper provides detailed descriptions of how the need for the OO-IO model emerged, how it has been used for both design and audit of the Danish bit repository, how we plan to use it for minimal effort ingest, and what other use cases there are for applying the OO-IO model for distributed digital preservation purposes. This will illustrate how using the OO-IO model can assist in the analysis of complex digital preservation tasks of a distributed OAIS-conformant repository, where the OO-IO model provides terminology and contribute to break down analysis and audit questions.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["kyoto"],"license":"CC BY-SA 4.0 International","date":"2017-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2017"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:931073","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:931073/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Unlike tools such as Adobe PreFlight or veraPDF which check against requirements at profile level, JHOVE’s PDF-module is the only tool that can validate the syntax and structure of PDF files. Despite JHOVE’s widespread and long-standing adoption, the underlying validation rules are not formally or thoroughly tested, leading to bugs going undetected for a long time. Furthermore, there is no ground-truth data set which can be used to understand and test PDF validation at the structural level.

As the world’s most comprehensive digital library collection of legacy biodiversity literature, the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) is dedicated to building and maintaining their repository by determining the scope of biodiversity literature and analyzing the collection strengths, weaknesses and gaps in the BHL corpus [1]. Regular analyses have been performed since the creation of BHL in 2006 and as the corpus expands and methods for analyzing literature in the public domain develop, continuous analysis of BHL coverage and gaps remains critical. In the course of 2017, BHL has the opportunity to work with a team of National Digital Stewardship Residents who are committed to developing a plan for the next generation of BHL.\nThis poster will illustrate the current research and progress of the collection analysis project of the National Digital Stewardship Resident (NDSR) project led by the resident hosted at the Chicago Botanic Garden’s Lenhardt Library.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["kyoto","poster"],"license":"CC BY-SA 4.0 International","date":"2017-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2017"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:931134","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:931134/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

This work also supports The National Archives’ strategic goal of becoming the Inclusive Archive.<br />The initial development of DiAGRAM aimed to bring the power and insight of Bayesian Networks to the community of digital archivists. The prototype tool successfully demonstrated this, however, the relatively short project timeframe and adoption of a rapid prototyping approach (with R/Shiny) imposed constraints on accessibility. We offer some lessons learned from the project in how we could have approached this more effectively.<br />With The National Archives’ own successful use of the prototype in support of an investment business case for improving our digital archive’s resilience the tool’s utility was sufficiently clear for a further phase of work. The contract was awarded to data analytics firm Jumping Rivers, who had also previously undertaken initial usability and accessibility improvements. A full external accessibility review was undertaken by TetraLogical.<br />The first part of this new project phase determined that the most appropriate way to proceed was to re-architect the DiAGRAM tool to separate the web front-end from the underlying model and connect the two via a new set of API endpoints. Opportunity was also taken to review the “Advanced customisation” modeling options to improve usability.<br />Redevelopment is now substantially complete although the formal retest to confirm full compliance with PSBAR is to take place later this month, however ongoing dialog with TetraLogical throughout development means no major issues are anticipated.<br />","full_text":null,"type":"long paper","categories":null,"keywords":["web accessibility","risk modeling"],"license":"CC-BY 4.0 International","date":"2022-09-16T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2022","institutions":"[\"The National Archives (UK)\"]"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://osf.io/x8g7e/","citation_pdf_url":"https://osf.io/download/ze6w2/","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://osf.io/download/vcn4f/","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://osf.io/download/dbcm3/","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://youtu.be/C9Jj-oBuFOA","citation_conference_submission_url":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/5564150/items/7LJYWMFJ/file"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES:osf:x8g7e","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Digital storytelling is one set of techniques that are being used to transmit memories into the future.

How might this be integrated further, and what benefits might extend to academics and researchers themselves? Often the difficulties or challenges of preservation result from scholarly research being generated and published without a preservation policy in mind, which can result in the knowledge becoming lost. This has a particularly emphasised effect upon smaller and scholar-led presses, who often do not have the inbuilt resilience typically provided by either a large business model or a memory institution, which can allow for archiving and preservation to occur procedurally. Our panel will consider the workflows involved, potential solutions, and what additional engagement may be necessary to increase awareness among publishers and researchers. COPIM’s Work Package 7 engages with complex digital OA monographs and the scholar-led publishing community. The Mellon-funded Embedding Preservability in New Forms of Scholarship project (NYU) embeds digital preservation experts with publishers from the beginning of the publishing process to help them to make choices that result in publications, including very complex ones, that can be preserved at scale. And Project JASPER works with small, independent OA journals to facilitate preservation.","full_text":null,"type":"panel","categories":null,"keywords":["open access","digital preservation","archiving"],"license":"CC-BY 4.0 International","date":"2022-09-16T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2022","institutions":"[\"Loughborough University\"]"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://osf.io/3jnqs/","citation_pdf_url":"https://osf.io/download/32z8n/","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://youtu.be/SEU1fsw-Sa8","citation_conference_submission_url":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/5564150/items/N8VK2RTI/file"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES:osf:3jnqs","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Therefore, these materials need to be preserved for a long time.  To predict the success of these materials in terms of long-term preservation, it is necessary to examine the capabilities of universities in this field.  While doing this review, is thought to benefit from the Rapid Assessment Model (RAM) created by Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC).  Because the RAM is designed to evaluate the digital preservation capability of organizations at a basic level. As a result of this evaluation, it will be possible for universities to improve their digital preservation capabilities and monitor their progress.

In addition, the file system would store two 4 digit codes for each file, one identifying the creating software and another identifying the type of file as extensions were rarely used.

Consequently, in this paper we present the design of a scalable archiving solution based on DNA, interfaced to OAIS-compliant digital repositories, and which allows an effective and efficient implementation on the long term in a perspective of saving research and patrimonial information.","full_text":null,"type":"short paper","categories":null,"keywords":["long-term preservation","oais","dna","olos.swiss"],"license":"CC-BY 4.0 International","date":"2022-09-16T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2022","institutions":"[\"University Of Geneva\"]"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://osf.io/7u4gh/","citation_pdf_url":"https://osf.io/download/ehpa9/","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://osf.io/download/kec2p/","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://osf.io/download/ef6b9/","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://youtu.be/IUxKpf-pA3g","citation_conference_submission_url":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/5564150/items/AVGSY6E8/file"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES:osf:7u4gh","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

It currently hosts material from more than 30 countries and in 24 languages, and from a variety of archival institutions (such as State and city archives,  university and parish archives, private institutions, etc). In order to navigate this extremely heterogeneous material, one of the research tools made available by Archives Portal Europe is by “topics”, curated collections in which each archival institution participating into the APE project can tag its documents according to a specific topic. Because topics are maintained manually by the archivists, and because of the vast amount of archival material ingested in the portal, it is impossible to have a comprehensive body of topics that describe the whole of the APE repository. <br /><br />In this scenario, automated topic detection can be a fundamental tool to guide archival research and to allow archives to be accessible to potentially world-wide users, in a situation where national and linguistics barriers blur, or are re-defined. <br /><br />This workshop presents the creation of an AI tool for automated topic detection in the APE corpus, a vast, inhomogeneous, and multi-lingual collection of historical archival catalogues – the first such project to be designed for archival descriptions rather than corpora of specific documents. <br /><br />The development is based on supervised machine learning, with a combination of human inputs in different languages (collectively-created taxonomies for each topic), and the usage of Wikipedia pages to model the relevant vocabulary and entities. The first iteration of the algorithm was tested on a sample of 9 topics in 5 languages, and the second iteration enlarged the sample to 13 topics and 12 languages, for a total of more than 500,000 descriptive units, and it also introduced Boolean operators and wildcards. <br /><br />The workshop will explain how the tool was built, and will allow users to test it live, gathering feedback on its usability and possible future implementations outside of the specific corpus of Archives Portal Europe. <br />","full_text":null,"type":"tutorial","categories":null,"keywords":["automated topic detection"],"license":"CC-BY 4.0 International","date":"2022-09-16T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2022","institutions":"[\"Archives Portal Europe Foundation (APEF)\"]"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://osf.io/d2j5p/","citation_pdf_url":"https://osf.io/download/jydtx/","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://osf.io/download/aujtx/","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://osf.io/download/ux52b/","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://youtu.be/hSw3TZG06Zw","citation_conference_submission_url":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/5564150/items/FG6R3QFR/file"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES:osf:d2j5p","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

A small but essential portion of the email has continuing value and  warrants long-term preservation. Many collecting institutions have acquired email accounts and collections. Unfortunately, the pipeline from email acquisition into digital preservation environments is still relatively immature. One of the fundamental challenges has been that formats for packaging email accounts (particularly PST) can be brittle, complex and dependent on proprietary software. Another fundamental challenge is that information within email can be subject to various sensitivities (e.g., protected health information, financial information) that collecting institutions must address. Without reliable and scalable tools to address these two challenges, email risks being locked into relatively hidden collections.  Quite the opposite of date for all!   <br />The creation of Archival Information Packages (AIP) depends on a variety of functions including, but not limited to: extracting email content from proprietary packages;  locating messages with retention value; identifying instances of sensitive and personally identifying information; and accurately tagging features of email messages, including those corresponding to real-world entities such as persons, places, organizations, and events. <br />The Review, Appraisal, and Triage of Mail (RATOM) project presented in this tutorial began as a two-year effort to develop and test software and workflows to support the review and processing of email in collecting institutions. The RATOM project developed software to scan email archive files (including PST, OST, and mbox) and record and export content, metadata, and derived features such as entities identified using natural language processing (NLP) into a simple SQLite database that can be queried as part of a larger set of digital curation workflows.<br />The RATOM tools are designed to minimize the effort required to run computationally complex email analysis tasks. For example, RATOM provides a single-command tool that makes it simple to replace the default NLP model used to identify entities with a model for a different language, a custom model, or a multi-language model. While some existing LAM access systems incorporate NLP to describe the contents of collections, this technology is often tightly coupled to the platform being used, or is applied strictly to file types that tend to share common structures and metadata. <br />Email contains encoded text, markup, and attachments, but importantly also structured metadata in the header that can be used to cue identification of persons and organizations and describe their relationships. Identifying entities, relationships, and other features of interest by processing open text from heterogeneous collections of files (such as those extracted from a disk image) is inherently “noisier,” as the extracted text will often contain patterns of features (such as persons, places, and organizations) common to a wide range of devices and production environments (e.g. documentation of system files). By exposing header metadata features in database entries where they are explicitly linked to entities identified in open text, the RATOM tools provide a mechanism by which cross-format search procedures can be easily implemented.<br />In this tutorial, participants will learn to work with the core RATOM tools, including the email processing library and associated command-line utilities. Using publicly available corpora including PST files from the Enron collection, participants will explore the different options provided by libratom and its utilities to extract content and metadata from email backup files, scan content for entities of interest, and query the SQLite database it produces as output. The tutorial will also include an introduction to selecting and working with pre-trained spaCy language models, and provide participants with a clear understanding of which models are appropriate for which tasks and use cases.<br />No programming experience or prior experience with command-line tools is required. Participants may bring a laptop with Windows 10 or 11, macOS 11 or 12, or modern Linux distribution (Ubuntu 22.04LTS or later) to fully participate. Instructions for installing the software in advance may be found at https://github.com/libratom/libratom/blob/master/README.md. However, it is not mandatory for participants to run the software on their own machines. The tutorial will be conducted in part using remotely hosted interactive notebooks and a web-based SQLite database browsing utility.<br />","full_text":null,"type":"tutorial","categories":null,"keywords":["email curation natural language processing"],"license":"CC-BY 4.0 International","date":"2022-09-16T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2022","institutions":"[\"University Of North Caroilina\"]"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://osf.io/f257a/","citation_pdf_url":"https://osf.io/download/42cjf/","citation_conference_submission_url":"https://api.zotero.org/groups/5564150/items/M7XS6QB6/file"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES:osf:f257a","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

As a result, the METS Editorial Board (MEB) has been contemplating a data model for a next generation METS schema that will facilitate these kinds of technologies. The initial approach to a new METS data model aligned very closely to metadata schemes in the preservation arena, namely PREMIS, but the MEB thought it essential to test the new METS 2.0 data model against existing canonical implementations of METS, and developing complementary data models.

While free commercial alternatives such as figshare and Dropbox provide high service functionality and intuitive user experience that serve research data creators well, they do not offer long term preservation reliability, nor do they necessarily share the increasingly important value of open data. From the perspective of the research data creator, however, all of these factors are important and desirable, so a preservation repository service targeting the needs of researchers should provide them. The UC Curation Center (UC3) at the California Digital Library created its Dash research data portal to address these needs. Following the initial deployment of the Dash service UC3 received feedback from users that additional functionality and a redesigned user interface would be desirable. With funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation UC3 has re-factored the infrastructure behind Dash, and improved the front-end user experience of the existing deposit service.

This happens due to low presence of solid evidence and a lack of accessible approaches to create such evidence. Software benchmarking, as an em-\npirical method, is used in various fields to provide objective evidence about the quality of software tools. However, the\ndigital preservation field is still missing a proper adoption of that method. This paper establishes a theory of benchmarking of tools in digital preservation as a solid method\nfor gathering and sharing the evidence needed to achieve widespread improvements in tool quality. To this end, we discuss and synthesize literature and experience on the theory and practice of benchmarking as a method and define a conceptual framework for benchmarks in digital preservation. Four benchmarks that address different digital preservation scenarios are presented. We compare existing reports on tool evaluation and how they address the main components of benchmarking, and we discuss the question of whether the field possesses the right combination of social factors that make benchmarking a promising method at this point in time. The conclusions point to significant opportunities for collaborative benchmarks and systematic evidence\nsharing, but also several major challenges ahead.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["benchmark","digital preservation","software quality"],"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2015-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2015"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:429547","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:429547/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

While digital\ncuration is a rapidly maturing field, it still lacks a convincing unified theoretical foundation. A recent internal evaluation by the University of California Curation Center (UC3) of its programmatic activities led quickly to seemingly simple, yet deceptively difficult-to-answer questions. Too many fundamental terms of curation practice remain overloaded and under-formalized, perhaps none more so than “digital object.” To address these concerns, UC3 is developing a new model for conceptualizing the curation domain. While drawing freely from many significant prior efforts, the UC3 Sept model also assumes that digital curation is an inherently semiotic activity.  Consequently, the model considers curated content with respect to six characteristic dimensions:  semantics, syntactics, empirics, pragmatics, diplomatics, and dynamics, which refer respectively to content’s underlying abstract meaning or emotional affect, symbolic encoding structures, physical representations, realizing behaviors, evidential authenticity and reliability, and evolution through time.  Correspondingly, the model defines an object typology of increasing consumer utility and value: blobs, artifacts, exemplars, products, assets, records, and heirlooms, which are respectively existential, intentional, purposeful, interpretable, useful, trustworthy, and resilient digital objects. Content engagement is modeled in terms of creator, owner, curator, and consumer roles acting within a continuum of concerns for catalyzing, organizing, and pluralizing curated content. Content policy and strategy are modeled in terms of seven high-level imperatives: predilect, collect, protect, introspect, project, connect, and reflect. A consistent, comprehensive, and conceptually parsimonious domain model is important for planning, performing, and evaluating programmatic activities in a rigorous and systematic rather than ad hoc or idiosyncratic manner. The UC3 Sept model can be used to make precise yet concise statements regarding curation intentions, activities, and results.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["digital curation","digital preservation","domain model","semiotics","continuum","policy","strategy"],"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2015-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2015"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:429533","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:429533/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The archival difficulty is based on the use of client-side technologies (e.g., JavaScript) to change the client-side state of a representation after it has initially loaded. We refer to these representations as deferred representations. We can better archive deferred representations using tools like headless browsing clients. We use 10,000 seed Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs) to explore the impact of including PhantomJS – a headless browsing tool – into the crawling process by comparing the performance of wget (the baseline), PhantomJS, and Heritrix. Heritrix crawled 2.065 URIs per second, 12.15 times faster than PhantomJS and 2.4 times faster than wget.  However, PhantomJS discovered 531,484 URIs, 1.75 times more than Heritrix and 4.11 times more than wget. To take advantage of the performance benefits of Heritrix and the URI discovery of PhantomJS, we recommend a tiered crawling strategy in which a classifier predicts whether a representation will be deferred or not, and only resources with deferred representations are crawled with PhantomJS while resources without deferred representations are crawled with Heritrix. We show that this approach is 5.2 times faster than using only PhantomJS and creates a frontier (set of URIs to be crawled) 1.8 times larger than using only Heritrix.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["web architecture","http","web archiving","memento"],"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2015-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2015"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:429536","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:429536/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Shane Coleman","Andrea Ogier","Mohamed Farag"],"abstract":"Geospatial data are widely used by many institutions, governments, and corporations; given the diversity of organizations concerned with geospatial data, preserving and curating these important digital files presents unique challenges to the preservation community. In the University Libraries at Virginia Tech a small project team is working to use a local implementation of GeoBlacklight to build a flexible geospatial data portal that addresses the needs of diverse stakeholders on campus, including those outside the context of academic research. This poster will present the results of an initial geospatial data assessment, the issues and concerns of each stakeholder on campus, and how the GeoBlacklight implementation addresses both the challenges posed by the stakeholders and by the complexity of geospatial data itself.\n\nThe Data Curation Unit in Newman Library at Virginia Tech is creating opportunities for geospatial discovery and preservation through collaboration with University Facilities and University IT. Libraries have long been known for institutional repositories that lack storage capacity and have outdated features. Through collaborative efforts with University Facilities and University IT the library has started implementation of an instance of GeoBlacklight to resolve these issues for our geospatial data users. The Facilities group has provided a variety of dataset use cases along with metadata schema input. IT has been responsible for setting up server space which allows for deposits of more than two gigabytes. The library has been responsible for the development of the interface. With this team we aim to provide a secure environment that incorporates the needs of non-academic patrons alongside a more traditional data repository, making it easier for campus users to deposit and extract data, and store larger sets of data than has previously been possible. This poster will present the results of our initial geospatial data assessment, the obstacles posed by working with numerous university stakeholders, and what we believe to be a sound solution for geospatial data discovery and preservation of both academic and non-academic geospatial data at Virginia Tech.\n\nGeospatial data generated for practical use (not specifically for research) became of interest once we began partnering with our University Facilities and University IT groups. We found that these campus departments frequently produce geospatial data that is often of interest to research groups across campus. In addition, there are several groups on campus that collect historical state government data containing geospatial components. Beginning with the acknowledgement that all data should be discoverable, we developed workflows that enable our GeoBlacklight instance to treat research and non-research data the same. Essentially we are creating a single discovery platform for all geospatial information acquired and created by Virginia Tech.\n\nWe also found significant benefit in the collaboration with University IT, including access to greater storage space and stricter backup protocols. This partnership was developed on the premise that the library would help curate and make discoverable all geospatial data in use at Virginia Tech, as long as they University IT was responsible for maintaining server space and managing the backup processes for the datasets in their care. This allowed us to have experts focus on the storage and management of geospatial data allowing library staff to focus on collection and curation of the data.\n\nIn essence, the GeoBlacklight project has become a means for better aligning the library as the central location for finding and accessing geospatial data at Virginia Tech, and has also allowed us to leverage campus partners to better optimize our ability to serve the discovery and preservation needs of the Virginia Tech community.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["geospatial data","gis","geoblacklight","hydra"],"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2015-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2015"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:429581","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:429581/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Preserving this in-house developed software is the goal of the National Digital Stewardship Residency Project, “NLM-Developed Software as Cultural Heritage.” This project will not only help ensure access to content created on this software, but, in the case of NLM, will also help document a long and often unrecognized intellectual history [1]. Although copyright concerns are largely avoided since the software was produced in-house, a variety of administrative obstacles still need to be addressed before the technical process of software preservation can begin. These obstacles include but are not limited to: (1) locating knowledge sources for software projects that are long defunct; (2) locating usable copies of software, either tangible or intangible, that may not have been properly documented or stored; and (3) tracing the history of projects that may have gone through several re-branding efforts or versioning’s. This poster will address these issues as they have affected the current project at NLM and will demonstrate how a properly conducted inventory is necessary for contending with these obstacles and ensuring a reliable long-term software preservation strategy.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["digital preservation","digital curation","chapel hill"],"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2015-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2015"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:429582","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:429582/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}
{"title":"Alternatives for Long-Term Storage Of Digital Information","url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/ipres/ipres-2015/papers/alternatives-for-long-term-storage-of-digital-information/","creators":["Chris Erickson","Barry Lunt"],"abstract":"The most fundamental component of digital preservation is managing the digital objects in archival repositories. Preservation Repositories must archive digital objects and associated metadata on an affordable and reliable type of digital storage. There are many storage options available; each institution should evaluate the available storage options in order to determine which options are best for their particular needs.\n\nThis poster examines three criteria in order to help preservationists determine the best storage option for their institution: Cost, Longevity, and the Migration Time frame. While Richard Wright maintains that “storage is becoming the lowest cost in a digital repository,” Cost is probably the single most important factor when considering long term storage. Cost may be a limiting factor in the number objects that are preserved. Chapman asserts that repository storage costs “must be affordable and manageable or content owners will withhold materials from deposit.” Storage costs, even if they are declining, may influence decision makers to select a low-cost storage option, at the expense of essential preservation needs. DeRidder, in her presentation “Considerations for Storage and Protection of Content”, lists Cost as the first factor in choosing a storage media option.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["digital preservation; digital storage; storage costs"],"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2015-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2015"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:429585","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:429585/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

This strategic focus, carried out through the initial Lisbon Strategy1 and the follow-up Europe 2020 strategy2 has contributed to a widespread shift toward e-governments and e-commerce. Ultimately, this has transformed the relationships between governments, citizens and business. From a technical perspective, a wide range of new information systems and communication methods have become available that streamline and automate transactions, enable integration of information and service delivery, and enhance collaboration between participants. It has also changed the ways of conducting public and private business, documenting activities, and making information available for reuse, aiding decision-making and supporting accountability. Much of this information has to remain available for long periods, often beyond the life expectancy of individual information systems or technological components. This poses a significant challenge for both the original data creators and digital archives that have to be capable of both dealing with the most current information technology, and with “saving” information from a variety of legacy systems. In order to deal with these challenges there is a need to bridge the gap between the methods used in digital preservation and content creation and introduce additional practical interoperability into the solutions used for a Digital Single Market and digital preservation infrastructures. The European Commission recognised the need in 2013 and funded the E-ARK project3 (2014 – 2017) which successfully delivered a set of principles, specifications and tools that provided an interoperable and international solution for the sustainable long-term availability of digital information. This paper describes the solutions first developed during the E-ARK project, focusing on the SIP format, as well as the steps the European Commission is taking towards building a thriving digital preservation community around the E-ARK outcomes.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["boston"],"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2018-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2018"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:923635","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:923635/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

In 2017, the UK Legal Deposit Libraries established an Emerging Formats project to look at selected types of content that were potentially in scope for NPLD. At the beginning of 2018, the British Library’s digital preservation team commenced research, as part of the project, into the preservation implications of some of these new forms of publication. Over the course of three months, the project analysed a small sample of interactive narrative works and mobile eBook apps from the Apple store. The evaluation revealed specific characteristics including: the automated personalization of narrative content; the integration of images taken by device cameras; movement-driven behavioural changes to item displays; the use of third party content to drive narratives forward; and, game-like features with a high dependency on visual, illustrated displays. Engagement with content experts underlined the significance of the interactive elements, suggesting that any subsequent preservation plans need to take this into account. Accompanying technical analysis using the Library’s format sustainability assessment framework identified issues around DRM (digital rights management), proprietary environments, and the use of third-party content. Whilst further research is clearly needed to validate the findings beyond the initial sample size and to resolve the technical challenges identified, other more conceptual questions remain about such matters as ownership, authority, provenance, versioning, and personalization. Engagement with content providers will be key to resolving all of these in a satisfactory manner.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["boston"],"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2018-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2018"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:923627","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:923627/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

What began as a discussion at the Fedora and Samvera Camp held in Oxford, UK in September of 2017 has grown into a focused community effort. Many repository systems store large amounts of data that are difficult to migrate, and such migrations risk data loss. Within a storage system, digital objects should be designed under the assumption that they will be accessed and managed by a variety of applications. This effort is an attempt to decouple the structure of the persisted files from the software that might manage it by creating an expectation of file hierarchy to which software applications must conform, whether implemented in a conventional filesystem with files and directories, or in an object store. Thus the file hierarchy functions as a storage Application Programming Interface (API). This effort addresses three primary requirements: 1) completeness, so that a repository can be rebuilt from the files, 2) parsability, both by humans and machines in the absence of original software, and 3) robustness against errors, corruption and migration between storage technologies. This paper describes motivations, principles and anticipated features of the proposed file layout.

Yet in other domains, this wisdom is approached quite differently. New hashing algorithms continue to be developed in the cryptography community, typically with very different use cases in mind, focusing on encryption and security over integrity or identification. Checksumming is also a key feature of modern filesystems. The implementers of these filesystems concern themselves with block-level integrity, rather than focus on ‘files’ or objects in the way digital preservation systems do. Cloud-based object storage systems also compute checksums, providing integrity guarantees as part of the service. And there is the blockchain - distributed peer to peer systems where hashing is fundamental.\nHow do we reconcile these different approaches to bit-level preservation using checksums? Can we compare the costs, in terms of compute resources or time, of the different approaches? Is there a way to verify the accepted wisdom of the digital preservation community and reconcile this with the diverse and expanding approaches to checksum validation?\nThis paper describes how checksumming functionality is understood and implemented in modern filesystems. A cost analysis is presented, comparing different approaches to data integrity, including pure CPU checksumming with tools such as md5sum, the block-level metadata used by filesystems such as ZFS, and the contrast with data integrity done by cloud service providers’ object storage services. From this analysis we describe the benefits of developing a new standard for mapping the block-level metadata produced by filesystem checksum reporting tools to the file-centered checksum reporting and validation required for adherence to current expectations of accepted digital preservation best practices. By better understanding different approaches to data integrity, it is possible to make better use of the computer hardware dedicated to digital preservation, taking advantage of the increased computational efficiency of filesystem-level checksumming techniques. This work closes a gap between current best practices in digital preservation and in high-performance computing. Sample code paths for working with and validating block checksums are also demonstrated.\"","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["boston"],"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2018-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2018"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:923643","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:923643/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}
{"title":"Adventures with ePub3 ","url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/ipres/ipres-2018/papers/adventures-with-epub3/","creators":["Maureen Pennock","Michael Day"],"abstract":"\"The role of standards in digital preservation is widely acknowledged. The current version of the ePub standard, used for publishing and disseminating eBooks, is ePub3, specifically 3.1 (January 2017). A marked difference from ePub2 is support for fixed layout files and, whilst several different ePub readers are available, not all have upgraded to provide full support for ePub3. In late 2017 and early 2018 the British Library’s digital preservation team undertook research into the impact of using an ePub viewer without explicit support for ePub3 on a mixed sample of ePub3 files. The sample comprised 54 files: 20 of these were of fixed layout, the remainder utilized reflowable layouts. For the analysis, content was accessed using two different open source ePub readers: Calibre, which has a wide user base but does not currently explicitly support ePub3, and Readium, which does explicitly support ePub3.\nePub3 files with a reflowable layout broadly rendered to an acceptable standard using both readers. There was one notable exception for both readers, and investigations indicated this was likely due to a problem with the file itself rather than the rendering software. Problems manifested in a more serious way when using Calibre to access just under half of the fixed layout ePub3 files. The rendering of these items inhibited access to intellectual content for example by overlaying it on other content, misrepresenting it, or not including it at all. Other issues that were initially apparent with the other half of the fixed layout sample were mostly resolved by the simple quick fix of switching from ‘page’ view to ‘flow’ view. By contrast, Readium was able to display all of fixed layout files correctly.\nThe research serves as a reminder that whilst standards remain an essential tool in the digital preservation toolbox, updates to a standard may necessitate changes to the rendering software in use. It further underlines the importance of accurate characterization so that repositories can identify formats at a version level or be able to identify items with explicit rendering needs beyond those served by their default rendering viewers.\"","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["boston"],"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2018-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2018"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:923650","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:923650/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

We then devised a process of reconstructing the invalid files and analyzing the converted data. Our results show that there are potentially working methods for avoiding problems during the PDF validation and these methods can significantly reduce the workload for preservation specialists who are responsible for the quality of the data.

However, traditional preserva- tion practitioners typically do not make these same decisions in a vacuum for analog collections; they are informed and prioritized by selectors, liaisons, or curators who make decisions based on con- tent and collection priorities in concert with information provided by the preservation practitioners. In this paper, we argue that this model should not change sim- ply because the nature of the materials has changed. While digital preservation may be new to an institution, basic preservation de- cisions are best prioritized by the people building collections and selecting content, which is complemented by the knowledge and expertise from digital preservation practitioners. Selectors and curators are collaborative preservation partners whose roles and expertise render them best able to judge the value of the content they collect. Digital preservation practitioners have an obligation to work with selectors and curators to help them understand the ways in which technical characteristics, descriptive records, and financial impact, along with value, affect selection choices for digital content and how these choices affect a digital preservation program. Digital preservation practitioners need to provide selectors and curators with guidelines and criteria to help them make informed selection decisions for digital content.\nIn this paper, we will address this issue in five parts. First, we review existing literature and workflows on the issue of selection for general collections. Second, we review existing literature on the topic of appraisal in special collections. Third, we provide an analysis of how these practices compare and contrast. Fourth, we discuss differences between preserving analog and digital content. Finally, we recommend specific guidelines and criteria geared to- ward selectors and curators to aid with content selection for digital preservation in both general and special collections.\"","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["boston"],"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2018-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2018"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:923633","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:923633/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Over time it became clear that new processes were required for born-digital material and, furthermore, we would need to accommodate the contrasting needs of Special Collections and Institutional Archives to preserve their born-digital content. For these reasons we have adjusted those original workflows, creating new tools and developing additional deposit processes along the way, with a very small team.\nWorking within the limitations of our digital preservation system and available resources has been challenging. While we have tried to standardize the workflows involved in digitization and digital preservation, we sometimes make adjustments to work with our varied and diverse collections. For example, due to differences in volume and access needs, the processing of Special Collections content tends to involve extensive, hand-edited metadata work while Institutional Archives files are processed in the aggregate. We try to make decisions that follow best practices for digital preservation, but ultimately we’re committed to getting the material into the system quickly, often prior to full processing, so it can be identified, validated, stored redundantly, and made accessible if appropriate, as backlogs continue to grow. In our efforts to preserve as much as possible now, we are likely creating more work for ourselves in the future, a possibility we confront regularly when weighing the importance of preservation needs versus access needs.\nIn this paper, we will discuss these challenges and focus on the practical decisions we have had to make when developing new deposit workflows, or adapting existing ones, on content that is in some way different than what came before. Our discussion will describe our different processes for digitized material and born- digital material both from Institutional Archives and from our Special Collections. We hope to provide guidance for those who are moving forward with “good enough” approaches instead of waiting for some magical day when we have all the time, staffing, and expertise to give our full attention and care to each filestream.\"","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["boston"],"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2018-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2018"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:923614","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:923614/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

These final stages included activities running in parallel to migrate the metadata for millions of files, train fifty-five different units to use the new repository tools, and migrate the audio files from obsolete formats.\nHarvard Library’s digital preservation repository, the Digital Repository Service (DRS), holds over 69 million files and 285 TB of data from across the university. When it first launched in October 2000, it was one of the first digital preservation repositories at an academic institution. At the time it was designed, there were little- to-no digital preservation/digital library standards, best practices or tools to adopt. Planning for a next-generation DRS under the name the “DRS2 project” began in 2008, with the purpose of modernizing the DRS to take advantage of the latest technologies, standards, and practices and to provide curators, depositors, and preservation staff with significantly enhanced tools.\nThe DRS2 project included four different types of migrations: infrastructure, metadata, file format, and repository users. It included such daunting tasks as re-architecting the entire repository; re-parsing all of the millions of files; changing the underlying data model, Archival Information Package (AIP) format, and all of the XML schemas; rewriting all of the repository metadata; retraining all of the repository users; and reformatting all of the audio deliverable files. A repository migration of this size and breadth was unprecedented in the digital preservation community, so there were few preexisting examples to learn from. By sharing the experience of this project, the authors hope that other institutions can benefit from the lessons learned during a repository migration of this magnitude.\nThis paper provides an overview of all four migrations, but delves deepest into the results, challenges and lessons learned from the metadata migration. These lessons are applicable to preservation planning and interventions, future migrations, preventing metadata and content errors, and conducting very large projects in general.\"","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["boston"],"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2018-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2018"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:923615","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:923615/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Since its establishment in 1867, the National Library of Mexico has collected unique and invaluable collections that are at the heart of Mexico's Bibliographic Heritage. It became the national Legal Deposit library in 1936, giving it the responsibility to create and care for the country’s documentary heritage. The Legal Deposit Decree was amended in 1991 in order to include electronic documents. In order to provide greater access to its collections, two main digital platforms were created: the Digital National Newspaper Library and the Digital National Library. This paper outlines the challenges the National Library of Mexico faces in order to preserve and provide long-term access to digital cultural collections and strategies that have been implemented so far. It shows how these impact on old rooted practices and how the library is planning to move forward in establishing sustainable approaches to guarantee the digital preservation of Mexico's documentary heritage.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["boston"],"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2018-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2018"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:923613","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:923613/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

In 2017, the UK Legal Deposit Libraries established an Emerging Formats project to look at selected types of content that were potentially in scope for NPLD. At the beginning of 2018, the British Library’s digital preservation team commenced research, as part of the project, into the preservation implications of some of these new forms of publication. Over the course of three months, the project analysed a small sample of interactive narrative works and mobile eBook apps from the Apple store. The evaluation revealed specific characteristics including: the automated personalization of narrative content; the integration of images taken by device cameras; movement-driven behavioural changes to item displays; the use of third party content to drive narratives forward; and, game-like features with a high dependency on visual, illustrated displays. Engagement with content experts underlined the significance of the interactive elements, suggesting that any subsequent preservation plans need to take this into account. Accompanying technical analysis using the Library’s format sustainability assessment framework identified issues around DRM (digital rights management), proprietary environments, and the use of third-party content. Whilst further research is clearly needed to validate the findings beyond the initial sample size and to resolve the technical challenges identified, other more conceptual questions remain about such matters as ownership, authority, provenance, versioning, and personalization. Engagement with content providers will be key to resolving all of these in a satisfactory manner.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["boston"],"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2018-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2018"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:923625","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:923625/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

A curator selects seeds, or original resources, which are then captured by an archiving system and stored as archived web pages, or mementos. The systems that build web archive collections are often configured to revisit the same original resource multiple times. This is incredibly useful for understanding an unfolding news story or the evolution of an organization. Unfortunately, over time, some of these original resources can go off-topic and no longer suit the purpose for which the collection was originally created. They can go off-topic due to web site redesigns, changes in domain ownership, financial issues, hacking, technical problems, or because their content has moved on from the original topic. Even though they are off-topic, the archiving system will still capture them, thus it becomes imperative to anyone performing research on these collections to identify these off-topic mementos. Hence, we present the Off-Topic Memento Toolkit, which allows users to detect off-topic mementos within web archive collections. The mementos identified by this toolkit can then be separately removed from a collection or merely excluded from downstream analysis. The following similarity measures are available: byte count, word count, cosine similarity, Jaccard distance, Sørensen-Dice distance, Simhash using raw text content, Simhash using term frequency, and Latent Semantic Indexing via the gensim library. We document the implementation of each of these similarity measures. We possess a gold standard dataset generated by manual analysis, which contains both off-topic and on-topic mementos. Using this gold standard dataset, we establish a default threshold corresponding to the best F1 score for each measure. We also provide an overview of potential future directions that the toolkit may take.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["boston"],"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2018-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2018"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:923618","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:923618/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The emphasized stories on a news website are often highly similar to many other news websites (e.g, a terrorist event story). The selective emphasis of a top news story and the similarity of news across different news organizations are well-known phenomena but not well-measured. We provide a method for identifying the top news story for a select set of U.S.- based news websites and then quantify the similarity across them. To achieve this, we first developed a headline and link extractor that parses select websites, and then examined ten United States based news website homepages during a three month period, No- vember 2016 to January 2017. Using archived copies, retrieved from the Internet Archive (IA), we discuss the methods and difficulties for parsing these websites, and how events such as a presidential election can lead news websites to alter their document representa- tion just for these events. We use our parser to extract k = 1, 3, 10 maximum number of stories for each news site. Second, we used the cosine similarity measure to calculate news similarity at 8PM Eastern Time for each day in the three months. The similarity scores show a buildup (0.335) before Election Day, with a declining value (0.328) on Election Day, and an increase (0.354) after Election Day. Our method shows that we can effectively identity top stories and quantify news similarity.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["boston"],"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2018-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2018"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:923617","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:923617/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The consortial nature of the system hosted and operated by TIB is a setup which isn’t explicitly taken into consideration by documentation accompanying certification procedures so far. Neither the Data Seal of Approval nor the nestor seal foresee a tiered model, where parts of an archival system’s responsibility – e.g., the technical infrastructure – fall into the responsibility of a system other than the one who actually makes archival decisions about the content captured within. Nevertheless, TIB and ZBW separately received the Data Seal of Approval in 2015 and the nestor seal in 2017.\nThe paper presents and critically reflects upon experiences made by TIB during the certification process. It describes the institutional resources which were required to accumulate the required documentation and how they are spread across different organizational units. The authors present incentives for formal certification and discuss if and how these incentives paid off.\nWhile combinations of organizational, technological and legal factors make for a plethora of different archives, leading to no two certification processes being the same, the outcome of this paper shall serve as guidance to those thinking about or concretely planning to undergo basic, extended or formal certification.

But how can one tell whether it has been effective or not? The evaluation of preservation efficacy has two dimensions: trustworthiness of managerial programs and systems; and successful use of managed resources. While the former has received extensive attention, the latter has been little investigated. This stems from an insufficiently broad conceptualization of the preservation enterprise, which should be viewed expansively as facilitating meaningful human communication across time and concomitant cultural distance. Communicological analysis leads to a semiotic- phenomenological model for preservation-enabled communication cognizant of the elusive nature of use, which is inherently contingent with respect to time, place, person, and purpose. Preservation success is positioned as an individual, rather than universal value, with a benchmark evaluation of situational verisimilitude, rather than absolute fidelity to an illusory canonical state and information experience. The proposed evaluative approach provides new conceptual clarity to preservation theory and practice, a more rigorous basis for illuminating the limits of preservation efficacy, and a more nuanced means of stating, measuring, and evaluating preservation intentions, expectations, and outcomes.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["boston"],"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2018-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2018"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:922204","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:922204/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Perceived preservation levels are a way to communicate preservation policies, options and actions to the various stakeholders in digital preservation a digital preservation system is capable and able of. While explicitly assigned or stated preservation levels are promises to adhere to a certain set of policies and decisions, it may be hard to impossible for a best effort preservation service to fulfill these expectations. Perceived preservation levels combine different outcomes from preservation actions with preservation options and available resources to convey a holistic view of the archive’s worflow and decision states. A preservation system providing information about current states of digital objects puts the data producers in a position to reassure themselves of the trustworthiness of the archive without the need of formal certification. This openness has implications not only for the trust relationship between producer and archive but provides the opportunity to constantly reassess the archive’s decisions and priorities from the outside.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["boston"],"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2018-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2018"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:922202","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:922202/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Part of our policy is the implementation of the so called preservation watch. Preservation watch as a concept was first minted in the European PLANETS project (2007-2011, http://www.planets-project.eu). It is part of the PLANETS functional model which is an elaboration of the OAIS function Preservation Planning. The PLANETS functional model describes the functions and processes of a preservation planning component of a digital repository. It has three important preservation functions: watch, planning and action. Preservation Watch monitors a variety of internal and external entities, including the content preserved in the digital repository itself. Critical or imminent risks are passed to Preservation Planning for further analysis and planning of subsequent Preservation Action. Preservation Watch will be included in the next revision of the OAIS standard.\nPreservation Watch has already partly been implemented at NaNeth. In 2018, however, we will fully implement an enhanced preservation watch in all departments of the organization: a 'horizontal' sustainable accessibility plan that is model-based, process-based and based on international standards and community best practices. The core of this plan is the structured monitoring of our own and external environment. For instance, the Collections department will monitor the state of the digital archives we keep in our repository, Public Services will monitor the needs of our user communities, Account Management will monitor developments within the ministerial departments whose archives in time will be transferred to us. The results of all these monitoring activities, under the coordination of preservation specialists, will be analysed for risks and opportunities in regular cycles. This will enable us to intervene in good time if the sustainable accessibility of information objects is threatened. We will also enlarge the model by adding the other OAIS functions (besides Planning): Creation, (pre)Ingest, Archival Storage, Data Management and Access. In this way we will cover the complete lifecycle of information objects, from creation to access. Eventually, we foresee a Preservation Watch on a national scale, under the umbrella of the Digital Heritage Network (DHN). The experiences of NaNeth in implementing a preservation watch function will be expanded to other organizations and domains in The Netherlands. The development of a collaborative knowledge base is also necessary as we evolve more and more towards a national preservation network.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["boston"],"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2018-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2018"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:922203","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:922203/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Archivematica’s Format Policy Register (FPR) and Preservica’s Linked Data Registry (LDR) both define what tools and rules to use when doing digital preservation and whilst these two approaches aim to solve similar problems, they are not interoperable. There is no way to share technical information between the two solutions and for users to share their experience on what approaches to use in different contexts and why. This hinders implementation and execution of digital preservation in an interoperable way within the digital preservation community. This paper presents new work by Artefactual, Arkivum, Preservica and Jisc on how Preservation Action Registries (PAR) could be used to capture and share technical best practice for the preservation of digital objects in the form of a corpus of machine-readable recommendations. The registry’s data model defines what tools can be used for different digital object formats, what properties can be extracted or measured and what preservation actions can be taken. The model includes contextual and historical information on the reasons why recommendations are being given. The information is versioned and includes the tool parameters and software environments needed to execute different preservation actions so they are directly ‘executable’ by preservation systems. Our model makes registry content accessible through APIs using a distributed set of registries rather than a single canonical source. In this way, information can be made available from a range of sources including central registries (moderated and curated) or by exchange directly between trusted peer institutions or systems. Preservation systems such as Archivematica and Preservica are able to publish to and consume content from these registries. The work is supported by Jisc as part of the Research Data Shared Service initiative and we believe is the first time that vendors, national service providers and end-users have all come together in this way. The PAR approach should engender greater confidence in digital preservation, provide users with more flexibility and knowledge sharing opportunities, and accelerate the adoption of digital preservation in new sectors.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["boston"],"license":"CC BY 4.0 International","date":"2018-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2018"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:922205","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:922205/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Today, there is a respectable community – in terms of size and quality – of “digital poets”, who publish their texts in the internet and whose literature above all shares one mutual feature: a prominent and crucial use of computer technologies. Being the cultural heritage for future generations, electronic literature is worth preserving, just as any other form of contemporary literature. Yet, due to its use of interactive and dynamic elements and reliance on the latest technology, contemporary electronic literature is extremely vulnerable and difficult to document. While archives, libraries and museums are still trying to develop preservation strategies for electronic literature, many of the early works have already volatilized. In Germany, two institutions and a cooperative network have joined forces in order to address this challenge concertedly: nestor, the network of expertise in long-term storage of digital resources, the German Literature Archive, and the German National Library.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["london"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2008-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2008"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294058","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:294058/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The core of the e-Depot is IBM’s Digital Information Archiving System (DIAS). This article will discuss the exercise of the KB/IBM Research Group to apply IBM’s Component Business Modelling (CBM) in a digital preservation environment. The CBM map is used by a process called Goal Service Modelling (GSM) to identify candidate services for future versions of the e-Depot. Heat maps are used for impact analysis – to discuss organisational structures, existing hardware and software solutions and business processes in the context of the CBM map.

That is what sets it apart from, for example, humanities scholarship as it has been historically undertaken in its published form. Thus it would follow that the sustaining of digital scholarship goes far beyond what is commonly known as digital preservation. In other words, sustaining digital scholarship is not just the difficult task of preserving the atomized digital objects (or even bits and bytes) but also the relationships among them. These relationships represent the digital world of authorial aggregation and distribution that also needs to be preserved.

McDonald","David Minor","Ardys Kozbial"],"abstract":"Over the last several decades, U.S. supercomputing centers such as the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), the National Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA), and the Texas Advanced Computer Center (TACC), along with national partnerships such as the National Partnership for Advanced Computational Infrastructure (NPACI) and TeraGrid have developed a rich tradition of support for advanced computing applications and infrastructure. In addition, these centers have developed some of the worlds longest continually operating archives of digital information. These characteristics enable such nationally-funded centers to become natural partners for the library and archive communities as they develop digital preservation infrastructure. Concepts which will be critically important to the development of long-term preservation networks, including cyberinfrastructure and data grids, have grown out of the National Science Foundation and its programs for supercomputer centers. The centers have also served as hosts for long-running development and testing of software tools for data management in distributed environments, including the SRB and iRODS data grid software. These centers are also natural sites for the deployment of necessary physical and virtualized cyberinfrastructure for digital preservation. Several important current and past initiatives, from InterPARES (Duranti) to Chronopolis have involved staff and resources at supercomputing centers working directly with archives and libraries.\nAlong with these opportunities, there are significant challenges to the integration of the current infrastructure involved in the support of advanced computational science, on the one hand, and services that support the community needs for digital preservation on the other. This paper provides an overview of software development and deployments in the context of supercomputing centers and national partnerships, describing foundational cyberinfrastructure efforts, which provide physical and logical support for more advanced digital collection and preservation projects in both the sciences and the humanities. The paper then surveys some important recent work at sites in the NSF’s national cyberinfrastructure project, the TeraGrid, related to the digital preservation arena. It also examines two projects that the Library of Congress' National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program Program (NDIIPP) has funded at SDSC to study large-scale, long-term digital archives. These projects provide valuable examples of collaborative digital preservation practice within the context of a shared U.S. cyberinfrastructure.\nFinally, we consider the possibilities for further development of digital preservation infrastructure and partnerships within the Teragrid and across international boundaries. The character of digital preservation development outside of the United States is briefly considered and compared, and future directions for international efforts are evaluated.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["london"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2008-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2008"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294168","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:294168/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Following on from our experiences throughout the UK LOCKSS Pilot Programme, this paper discusses the organizational attributes of the LOCKSS approach that we expect to further develop in the UK, describes the types of journal content that the current generation of LOCKSS seems best suited to handle and as a result how LOCKSS may fit into the broader journal archiving environment, and it describes the steps we are taking to ensure both the LOCKSS software and Technical Support Service grow effectively to support library use and information management.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["london"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2008-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2008"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294175","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:294175/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Over time, maintaining access to the resources stored within SRB data grids will become increasingly difficult as file formats become obsolete. Organizations are struggling with the challenge of monitoring the formats in their SRB collections and providing suitable migration or emulation services as required. Automated methods are required that notify collections managers of objects that are at risk and that provide solutions to ensure long term access. The problem is exacerbated by the often proprietary and highly eclectic range of formats employed by scientific disciplines – many of which are too uncommon to be considered by existing national digital preservation initiatives. This paper describes our test bed implementation of a set of preservation services (obsolescence detection, notification and migration) over a heterogeneous distributed collection of objects, stored in SRB. It also provides an evaluation of the performance and usability of the PresSRB system, within the context of an environmental case study.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["london"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2008-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2008"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294150","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:294150/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The focus of this work reflects the service composition part within the SOA service concept. Previously released approaches have been separately using process-oriented models to describe the behaviour of services, and structure composition models to represent service interactions. In this paper, the authors attempt to combine the even mentioned disjunctive models to obtain a comprehensive model, which represents both, the structure and the behaviour of the services. For this purpose, the novel SCA2-BPEL3 serves as basis for the implementation in a future-oriented SOA-compliant digital preservation software system. The SCA-model specifies the architecture of the intended system, while the BPEL-model indicates the behavior of each service, which is defined in the SCA-model. We can conclude that the SCA-BPEL approach is well-suited for building a scalable, adaptable and service-oriented software system. The knowledge gained from the conceptual framework will serve as a basis for future digital preservation developments.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["london","service oriented architectures","digital preservation","service component architecture","business process execution language"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2008-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2008"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294163","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:294163/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

An archive can handle the matter by keeping the number of the single elements in the core areas of digital preservation down. The numbers of action types during the ingest process, of metadata and journals could be reduced. A preservation model for analogue and digital records is outlined. By keeping complexity down, it’s easier to see what digital and analogue archiving have in common. Instead of seeing two totally different worlds (here is the old one, there is the new one), one can shift to a less revolutionary view. This makes it possible to fall back on the considerable implicit knowledge of the existing memory institutions. From the perspective of the whole archive, there are strong arguments for reducing complexity and keeping digital and analogue things together whenever possible. Complexity can also be handled by cooperation. The Landesarchiv Baden-Württemberg appreciates the opportunity to use the software tools DROID and JHOVE. The BOA project is a further example for a venture in website archiving that is maintained by libraries and archives collaboratively. Cooperation and the reduction of complexity are the two most promising ways to enable small and medium sized archives to start with digital preservation. Automation seems to be a good thing whenever it can be achieved, but until this stage is reached, the single steps and the standards which must be followed often are extremely complex.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["london"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2008-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2008"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294182","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:294182/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Most of the member institutions of the International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC) use the software Heritrix to harvest selected Web pages or complete domains. The results are stored in the container format ARC or the successor WARC. The files’ quantity and the sizes of these archival packages are significantly different than those of the other publications in the existing archiving systems. This challenges the way the archival packages are defined and handled in current OAIS compliant systems.\nThis paper compares existing approaches to use METS and Web harvesting results in archival systems.

These projects are decided by the DLP programme board and are managed by the wider corporate governance structure which includes our legal deposit responsibilities. As part of this work it was identified by the Digital Preservation Team (DPT) that a significant number of handheld media (CDROM, DVD, Tape) within the BL collections may be at increased risk of obsolescence or decay due to the increased time they may spend on handheld media. The DPT and DLP agreed that an assessment should be undertaken and the results used to help prioritize future ingest. \nThe DPT conducted this risk assessment exercise in order to assess the condition of the BL digital collections, identify strategies to mitigate those risks, and recommend and plan actions to be taken. A risk assessment methodology based on the AS/NZS 4360:2004 standard was applied in a representative manner across these collections. The Risk Assessment concluded that the BL’s digital collections face an array of risks that will require action on a number of fronts. Almost all of the hand held (physical carrier) collections were assessed to be at high risk. The greatest and most imminent threat of loss is from media degradation. Failure rates for discs within the collections have reached high levels (up to 3%). Additionally substantial quantities of digital objects are stored as single copies only, on handheld media in danger of decay. This stark warning was illustrated by many examples of disc decay that have been encountered and is backed up by the evidence from external research into handheld media lifetimes. Digital content will continue to be lost unless action is taken now. The report made a number of specific recommendations to mitigate the highest risks facing the BL’s digital collections. These include:\n- Secure collections that are currently stored on handheld media as a matter of urgency. (Move the collections from CD/DVD etc)\n- Perform further assessment to gain a better understanding of the media failure rates across the different collections\n- Address the root causes of a number of the risks facing the collections, by streamlining and enhancing standards, check-in procedures and other policy issues \nIn order to achieve this a number of organisational changes have had to be undertaken that will eventually become measurable benefits.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["london"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2008-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2008"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294139","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:294139/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Within the last ten years, however, the increasing complexity of CAD models and their tighter integration into the workflow of engineering enterprises has led to their becoming the definitive expression of a design. At the same time, a paradigm shift has been emerging whereby manufacturers and construction companies enter into contracts to take responsibility for the whole lifecycle of their products – in effect, to sell their product as a service rather than as an artefact. This makes necessary not only the preservation of the product’s design, but also its continuing intelligibility, adaptability and reusability throughout the product’s lifecycle. The CAD models themselves, though, are typically in closed formats tied to a particular version of an expensive proprietary application prone to rapid obsolescence. While product lifecycle management (PLM) systems deal with some of the issues arising from this, at present it is not possible to implement a comprehensive curation and preservation architecture for CAD models, let alone the other forms of engineering information. In order to fill in some of the gaps in a possible architecture, we have developed two tools to aid in the curation and preservation of CAD models. The first is a preservation planning tool for CAD models: a Registry/Repository of Representation Information for Engineering (RRoRIfE). The tool uses Representation Information, as defined by the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model, to advise on suitable strategies for migrating CAD models to archival or exchange formats. The second – Lightweight Models with Multilayered Annotations (LiMMA) – is an architecture for layering non-geometric information on top of a geometric model, regardless of the format used for the geometric model. We envision this architecture being used not only to create flexible, lightweight archival representations of model data, but also to facilitate better information flows between a design team and the rest of the extended enterprise.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["london"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2008-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2008"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294109","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:294109/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

In this paper we discuss strategies for the digital preservation of console video games. We look into challenges like proprietary hardware and unavailable documentation as well as the big variety of media and non-standard controllers. Then a case study on console video game preservation is shown utilizing the Planets preservation planning approach for evaluating preservation strategies in a documented decision-making process. While previous case studies concentrated on migration, we compared emulation and migration using a requirements tree. Experiments were carried out to compare different emulators as well as other approaches first for a single console video game system, then for different console systems of the same era and finally for systems of all eras. Comparison and discussion of results show that, while emulation works in principle very well for early console video games, various problems exist for the general use as a digital preservation alternative. It also shows that the Planets preservation planning workflow can be used for both emulation and migration in the same planning process and that the selection of suitable sample records is crucial.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["london"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2008-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2008"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294111","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:294111/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

They must consider the strategy, policy, goals, and constraints of the institution that undertakes them and take into account the cultural and institutional framework in which data, documents and records are preserved. Furthermore, because organizations differ in many ways, a one-sizefits-all approach cannot be appropriate. Fortunately, organizations involved in digital preservation have created documents describing their policies, strategies, workflows, plans, and goals to provide guidance. They also have skilled staff who are aware of sometimes unwritten considerations. Within Planets [Farquhar 2007], a four-year project cofunded by the European Union to address core digital preservation challenges, we have analyzed preservation guiding documents and interviewed staff from libraries, archives, and data centers that are actively engaged in digital preservation. This paper introduces a conceptual model for expressing the core concepts and requirements that appear in preservation guiding documents. It defines a specific vocabulary that institutions can reuse for expressing their own policies and strategies. In addition to providing a conceptual framework, the model and vocabulary support automated preservation planning tools through an XML representation.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["london"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2008-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2008"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294097","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:294097/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

This paper combines the existing concept of a view path, which captures contextual information of software, together with new insights to improve the concept with extra metadata. It provides regularly updated instructions for archival management to preserve and access its artifacts. The view path model requires extensions of the metadata set of primary object of interest and depends on additionally stored secondary objects for environment recreation like applications or operating systems.

{"title":"Repository and Preservation Storage Architecture","url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/ipres/ipres-2008/papers/repository-and-preservation-storage-architecture/","creators":["Keith Rajecki"],"abstract":"While the Open Archive Information System (OAIS) model has become the de facto standard for preservation archives, the design and implementation of a repository or reliable long term archive lacks adopted technology standards and design best practices. This paper is intended to provide guidelines and recommendations for standards implementation and best practices for a viable, cost effective, and reliable repository and preservation storage architecture. This architecture is based on a combination of open source and commercially supported software and systems.\nAlthough several operating systems currently exist, the logical choice for an archive storage system is an open source operating system, of which  there are two primary choices today: Linux and Solaris. There are many varieties of Linux available and supported by nearly all system manufacturers. The Solaris Operating System is freely downloadable from Sun Microsystems. Many variants of the Linux operating system and Solaris are available with support on a fee base.\nThe Hierarchical Storage System, or HSM, is a key software element of the archive. The HSM provides one of the key components that contributes to reliability by through data integrity checks and automated file migration. The HSM provides the ability to automate making multiples copies of files, auditing files for errors based on checksum, rejecting bad copies of files and making new copies based on the results of those audits. The HSM also provides the ability to read in an older file format and write-out a new file format thus migrating the format and application information required to ensure archival integrity of the stored content. The automation of these functions provides for improved performance and reduced operating costs.\nThe Sun StorageTek Storage Archive Manager (SAM) software provides the core functionality of the recommended preservation storage architecture. SAM provides policy based data classification and placement across a multitude of storage devices from high speed disk, low cost disk, or tape. SAM also simplifies data management by providing centralized metadata. SAM is a self-protecting file system with continuous file integrity checks.\nThe digital content archive provides the content repository (or digital vault) within Sun's award-winning Digital Asset Management Reference Architecture (DAM RA). DAM RA enables digital workflow and the content archive provides permanent access to digital content files.\nWith SAM software, the files are stored, tracked, and retrieved based on the archival requirements. Files are seamlessly and transparently available to other services. SAM software creates virtually limitless capacity. Its scalability allows for continual growth throughout the archive with support for all data types. The policy based SAM software stores and manages data for compliance and non-compliance archives using a tiered storage approach with integrated disk and tape into a seamless storage solution, SAM software simplifies the archive storage. Allows you to automate data management policies based on file attributes. You can manage data according to the storage and access requirements of each user on the system and decide how data is grouped, copied, and accessed based on the needs of the application and the users. Helps you maximize return on investments by storing data on the media type appropriate for the life cycle of the data and simplifying system administration.\nSun Open Storage solutions provide the systems built with an open architecture using industry-standard hardware and opensource software. This open architecture allows the most flexible selection of the hardware and software components to best meet storage requirements. In a closed storage environment, all the components of a closed system must come from the vendor. Customers are locked into buying disk drives, controllers, and proprietary software features from a single vendor at premium prices and typically cannot add their own drives or software to improve functionality or reduce the cost of the closed system. Long term preservation is directly dependant on the long term viability of the software components. Open source solutions offer the most viable long term option with open access and community based development and support.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["london"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2008-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2008"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294149","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:294149/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

In order to overcome these, we propose a grid based framework for digital preservation. In this paper we describe the main objectives of the project SHAMAN and the identified challenges for such a heterogeneous and distributed environment.

However, the digital data associated with peer-reviewed publications is only rarely archived. Most often, astronomers publish graphical representations of their data but not the data themselves. Other astronomers cannot readily inspect the data to either confirm the interpretation presented in a paper or extend the analysis. Highly processed data sets reside on departmental servers and the personal computers of astronomers, and may or may not be available a few years hence. We are investigating ways to preserve and curate the digital data associated with peer-reviewed journals in astronomy. The technology and standards of the VO provide one component of the necessary technology. A variety of underlying systems can be used to physically host a data repository, and indeed this repository need not be centralized. The repository, however, must be managed and data must be documented through high quality, curated metadata.

This is especially interesting, given that in social science these domain-specific repositories have been in existence for many decades. The goal of this presentation is to juxtapose these two kinds of repositories and to suggest ways that they can help build partnerships between themselves and with the research community. It is based on the fundamental idea that all the parties involved share important goals, and that by working together these goals can be advanced successfully. We will begin by characterizing the life cycle of social science research, before turning to key elements of the two different kinds of repositories, and then to our recommendation that researchers and the two different kinds of repositories can forge partnerships. The key message is that by visualizing the role of repositories explicitly in the life cycle of the social science research enterprise, the ways that the partnerships work will be clear. These workings can be seen as a sequence of reciprocal information flows between parties to the process, triggers that signal that one party or another has a task to perform, and hand-offs of information from one party to another that take place at crucial moments. This approach envisions both cooperation and specialization. The researcher produces the scientific product, both data and publications; the institutional repository has specialized knowledge of campus conditions and the opportunity to interact frequently with the researcher; and the domain-specific repository has specialized knowledge of approaches to data in a specific scientific field, for example domain-specific metadata standards, as well as the ability to give high-impact exposure to research products.","full_text":null,"type":"presentation","categories":null,"keywords":["ithaca"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2006-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2006"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294566","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:294566/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

It is uncertain, however, whether the traditional model, based on national deposits and geographical frontiers, will be able to guarantee the long-term safety of the international academic output in a digital form. Academic literature is produced by multinational publishers, and has often no longer a country of origin that can be easily identified and thus no obvious guardian. Hence, in the traditional model there is a huge risk of academic records being lost forever. A systematic and more concentrated approach is needed to address this unacceptable risk.

Preservation can be considered as a complex spatial and chronological network of challenges, and associated risks. For example the organisational, financial, technological and operational contexts within which a repository resides and the extent to which it is capable of managing them must be ascertained if an audit is to be able to assert the likelihood of the institution's success. Significant effort must be directed towards the definition of methodologies for identifying appropriate classes of evidence, to their evaluation, and to the attaching of weight to them. Formal means are required to facilitate the analysis and comparison of disparate evidence types in order to enable auditors to accommodate a diverse range of physical, testimonial and experiment-based proof. In addition to binary systems of inquiry (e.g., does the organisation have a mission statement?) auditors must display an ability to distinguish the most persuasive examples from those that provide less substantive evidence of organisational competence. Similarly, if, for instance, a significant proportion of staff reveal that they have no idea of the content of their organisation's mission statement then this must be reflected in the overall organisational assessment. A comprehensive insight, and consequent decision, can only be reached after fully exploring the evidential basis upon which compliance is to be founded. This discussion of evidential appraisal techniques for repository audit reflects the series of pilot audits undertaken by the Digital Curation Centre within a selection of UK data centres and archives, including the Beazley Archive and the British Atmospheric Data Centre.","full_text":null,"type":"presentation","categories":null,"keywords":["ithaca"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2006-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2006"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294550","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:294550/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Since 2003 we have been running DSpace repository software in the School of Information, University of Texas at Austin, at first simply as a testbed for student work but since spring of 2005 as an institutional archival repository. In the course of this experience, following the “seed-evolve-reseed” model developed by Gerhard Fischer at the University of Colorado for collaborative development of computing environments, we have begun to demonstrate the value of such a repository in several different directions: fulfilling the state of Texas statutory requirements for preserving official documents (in which the official version of administrative information is posted on the School’s website); providing faculty (and students) with preprint and postprint exposure of their work; providing secure storage for learning objects, including presentations and tutorials; providing secure archiving for digital materials of historical value both to the School and to the discipline; providing an environment for students to work on the problems of digital archiving, populated with objects that will over time and in their turn demonstrate further problems of digital archiving; and providing the Information Technology service with a secure archive for versions of installed software and content. These uses within the School alone are beginning to weigh securely enough in the balance to warrant commitment of funding for the provision of infrastructure to the tasks of administering and delivering educational services.","full_text":null,"type":"presentation","categories":null,"keywords":["ithaca"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2006-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2006"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294551","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:294551/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}
{"title":"DAITSS and the Florida Digital Archive","url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/ipres/ipres-2006/papers/daitss-and-the-florida-digital-archive/","creators":["Priscilla Caplan"],"abstract":"    The Florida Digital Archive (FDA) is a digital preservation repository run by the Florida Center for Library Automation (FCLA) for the use of the eleven public universities of Florida. The FDA went into production in November 2005. It ingested 108,607 files (2.2 TB) in the first 6 months of operation. The FDA uses a locally developed software application called DAITSS to support the repository functions of ingest, data management and dissemination, and the preservation functions of format normalization and format migration. Functionally, DAITSS consists of a set of services. The Ingest Service performs format validation, extraction of technical metadata, creation of derivative files through normalization and/or migration, and storage preparation. Storage Maintenance assures that stored masters remain good copies on readable media. The Access Service is responsible for access control, reporting, and building Dissemination Information Packages in response to requests. Other services include Withdrawal and Repository Management. The system does not support discovery functions for end-users or real-time online access to archived materials. It can, however, be used as a preservation back-end to institutional repositories, publishing systems, digital libraries, or other user oriented applications. Following the OAIS reference model, DAITSS assumes a community of Producers who select, prepare and submit materials for preservation. In the FDA context, these are the libraries of the public universities of Florida, which have negotiated archiving agreements with the repository. To date, most submissions have been preservation masters from local digitization projects, and electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs). This presentation will give an overview of the Florida Digital Archive and the underlying DAITSS application, which is targeted for release as Open Source Software in 2006.","full_text":null,"type":"presentation","categories":null,"keywords":["ithaca"],"license":"CC BY-SA 3.0 AT","date":"2006-09-01T00:00:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2006"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://phaidra.univie.ac.at/o:294553","citation_pdf_url":"https://services.phaidra.univie.ac.at/api/object/o:294553/download"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

It is not enough to just store documents, datasets, images, and other resources in repositories where they can be searched and accessed.   The networked landscape in which we live inspires more and calls upon us to develop information architectures that promote (1) the creation of complex digital objects that consist of both local and remote content, (2) the ability to interconnect digital objects that reside in distributed repositories, (3) the ability to re-use objects or their components in the creation of new resources.  All of these requirements have implications for how we build digital libraries, repositories, and scholarly information systems in the future, and they also present significant challenges for digital preservation. In this talk I will discuss how the Fedora Project is approaching the digital preservation problem. In particular, I will highlight key aspects of the Fedora repository system and service framework that are preservation-enabling. I will also review current work undertaken by the Fedora Project in collaboration with the Fedora Preservation Working Group.

For sound recordings, digital practices have been established in both memory institutions and the industry, although issues regarding multi-track productions are troublesome for the industry. For video, digital approaches are widely used for reformatting by libraries and for new broadcast production, but most video masters continue to be recorded on conventional digital videotape rather than as media-independent digital file formats. For theatrical films, most memory institutions continue to reformat using proven photo-chemical approaches.  Meanwhile, the production of new theatrical films is genuinely hybrid: Hollywood's current workflow mixes digital and film-based stages and elements. It is also the case, however, that high costs and the lack of relevant standards prevent motion picture producers from identifying and implementing a clear-cut digital solution for the long-term archiving of their valuable production assets. In all three areas--sound, video, and cinema--memory institutions and the industry face similar problems.

The checklist was based upon international standards and community best practices for digital preservation as well as influences from information technology and information security standards. The goal was to develop metrics to evaluate three aspects influencing repository trustworthiness: the characteristics of the archiving organization that affect performance, accountability, and business continuity; technologies and technical infrastructure employed by the repository; and finally the processes and procedures utilized by the repository. A draft checklist was released for public consumption and comment in August 2005, leading to further development. In addition, the checklist has been leveraged by the Center for Research Libraries Auditing and Certification of Digital Archives project and used in test audits of three digital repositories and archives. Through public comment, practical application, and other CRL project activities, we have made further progress toward the development of a fully-fledged program of audit & certification for digital repositories.

It is energy, in the form of electricity, which allows us to write physical marks on various substrates and energy which allows us to read those marks. The industrial revolution, powered by coal and oil, supercharged our technology by greatly increasing the amount of energy available to us at only the cost of extraction. This surge of cheap energy into our civilization was what allowed us to advance our technology and develop computers and the digital realm. As we move into the middle of this century, energy will affect our ability to preserve digital materials in two critical ways. First, the age of cheap oil is coming to an end. As oil becomes more expensive to extract, less and less energy will be available. Second, the byproducts of burning fossil fuels such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrogen, create greenhouse gasses (GHGs) which have warmed our atmosphere and destabilized our climate. The more energy we use from fossil fuels, the more we create an inhospitable planet. In order to proactively plan for the future ahead of us, the digital preservation community needs to become aware of the risks inherent in our critical dependency on energy and enact adaptation strategies to address those threats.

This involved creating a disc image of the two SCSI hard drives installed in a Celsius Siemens 400 computer. To complement the in-house skills, the media conservation department of the Kunsthaus Zürich called upon the expertise of Tom Ensom and Robin François to benefit from their experience in disk imaging, legacy computing and Linux applications. After testing a combination of approaches and tools to image the drives, we used the Aaru Remote tool to remotely image the computer over a network connection. After backing up the hard drives, the original setup was tested and the computer was found to be functional. For the first time in 20 years this original hardware could be documented and preparations made for ensuring the longevity of the artwork. Through this interdisciplinary collaboration, we have demonstrated the use of remote disk imaging, an approach that will have wider applications in digital preservation — particularly where physical access to storage media is difficult or obsolete interfaces are present.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["information technology for dp","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-19T13:30:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/cylsieok/","citation_pdf_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/cylsieok/download/pdf","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jkLy26qKBt6bkZjWSKhmT_SudlFGAbNIhY_DyzajT1o/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/43124092cfc04d7ca607958cd2803d1773a96039b77c4cf9843d5b99eb64be11"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Most cloud storage vendors offer guarantees of file durability that call into question the need for continuous fixity checking as often performed by repositories with file servers located on-premises. At the same time, cloud vendors tend to charge fees for bringing computational resources to bear on individual files, turning continuous fixity checking into a potentially burdensome expense. With these technical and business considerations in mind, this paper explores one institution’s solution to verifying fixity in a repository of approximately seventeen million files after transition from on-site to cloud storage.

This work is being undertaken within academic and cultural institutions and also by the public. Some of this heritage exists on cassette tapes upon which data is encoded as sound. Current preservation practices implicitly privilege the preservation of the bytes encoded on the tape but not necessarily the original audio signal itself. This case study of Australian educational programs recovered from 40 year old cassettes suggests that their original signals contain evidence of an atypical mastering process and in doing so exemplify Kirschenbaum’s (2008) delineation between the forensic and formal materiality of digital objects. By extending this delineation, for the first time, to software on cassette this article attests to the ongoing theoretical value of Kirschenbaum’s thesis. It further suggests that cassette software preservation practices be aligned with those of physical object conservation in which an ethical responsibility to preserve ‘evidence of manufacture’ has long been acknowledged.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["information technology for dp","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-19T09:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/1qbrzqr0/","citation_pdf_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/1qbrzqr0/download/pdf","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/185lG4aMfAMXgyb_bH06C6dzEcfuLj62A540mo_Uibos/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/37e24c918bf84b0fad25a0836ae00456572f987242854f37936d92e33fe9f149"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

From the humble beginnings of extracting digital legacy records to navigating the labyrinth of complex data formats and relationships, our expedition mirrors a voyage through time. Arriving at our desired destination, the launch of QSA Digital Archive, it's as if we've barely beat the clock.\nLike Marty McFly's quest to alter the future, we have challenged conventional thinking, remodelled the way we engage with our agencies, reshaped transfer processes and workflows to adapt to the ever-evolving landscape of digital preservation and the needs of our users. Along the way, we have recalibrated our assumptions and questioned the very feasibility of transfers themselves, grappling with the reality of preserving our digital heritage in a rapidly changing world. \nAs we reflect on our odyssey, we ponder: is this the future we envisioned when we embarked on our quest to safeguard our digital legacy, or do we fear that the legacy will become lost to the memories of future generations despite our ambitions? \nAs we navigate the digital archive time machine to explore the agency landscape, are we encountering confidence and readiness to confront the challenges ahead? The digital preservation maturity of our agencies varies significantly, ranging from struggles in identifying permanent digital records to grappling with creators of large, complex datasets that exceed the capabilities of this iteration of the digital archive.\nJoin us as we delve into these questions and envision the path forward in preserving Queensland's digital heritage for generations to come.  By harnessing the power of technology, embracing interdisciplinary approaches, and fostering a culture of preservation, our mission is to build archives that stand the test of time.","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["communications and advocacy for dp","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-18T15:35:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13732254","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13732254","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13732254","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1coSQGZ5jVNK0VwwLWUyBu-JIkNkKuQH-qHnOUyj_KzA/edit#heading=h.ge8kdqo3zbiz","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/b27936ff02184e1fbce3a6cbad4e50932f2972e78ce34bdf91e5c1f936647db4"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

CHARM addresses this with a newly innovative, and comprehensive reference model and corresponding vocabulary for the digital preservation risk domain. Inspired by risk science, a signature feature of CHARM is its applied distinction between conceptual and characterized digital preservation risk. CHARM establishes a conceptual definition of digital preservation risk built around a purposeful definition of digital preservation as a goal and value-based endeavour, then deconstructs this to develop a cascading and logical series of abstract models for the whole digital preservation domain. This paper introduces the methodology though which CHARM was developed, presents and explains some of the key CHARM models, and discusses some of the methods through which CHARM can support scoped yet holistic risk identification and risk assessment exercises.

DDS had as its mission to enable the general public to explore the possibilities of the then-new internet. As stated by the founders the interface was supposed to be user-friendly to such an extent that even people with no computer experience would be able to use it. But looking at the history of DDS, some of these initial values hardly came to fruition because others like innovation were prioritized. The ideological commitments of the founders arguably predetermined which values would win out in practice. In this article I will illustrate how DDS can be analysed as charismatic technology to explain how underlying values influenced the design and how this impacted the community. Understanding how conflicting values, ambiguity and doubt were handled by the management of this early online community is an important lesson for preservation. On a practical level we need to know how to inform our designated community about these conflicting values as available in the representation information on this important UNESCO-heritage collection. What do we want our users to understand about it? At a deeper level we can see parallels between the community of DDS and our own community: the designated community. Lessons learned through analyzing the historical struggles of trying to make the DDS-community more diverse might still be relevant if we aim to understand more about how to apply the concept of the designated community within our own institutions.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-17T16:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/84dbwdby/","citation_pdf_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/84dbwdby/download/pdf","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QaM-23veDJpSDV0c31avxpj7N9yzi82UpA5LXQjgyRM/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/32af20969ae4432e92ec34b4858d646eb0bc0e923d964404a63fd266c97ef4ee"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The metadata are collected from these repositories, enriched with metadata from other sources, and then transformed to accord with the Swedish National Archives recent implementation (aka FGS 2.0) of the European Common Specification for Information Packages (E-ARK CSIP) and Specification for Submission Information Packages (E-ARK SIP) versions 2.1.0. The metadata records are then stored in the SU local (temporal) archive together with the associated data files harvested simultaneously. Part of the motivation for this preparatory digital preservation work are the perceived risks of trusting the digital preservation of research data files produced by SU reseachers to external repositories, that we do not fully control locally. The end product of this harvest and transformation processing are SIPs (Submission Information Packages), still awaiting future transformation to AIPs (Archival Information Packages) and eventually DIPs (Dissemination Information Packages). The associated data files are not transformed or converted in this first step towards long-term preservation and archiving, but we keep track of the file formats ingested partly by mapping file extensions to mimetypes in a special registry xml-file, used in the transformation processing and continuously updated whenever \"new\" file formats are encountered for the first time.\n\nThe software scripts that were developed for this \"harvester combine\" are in BASH Unix Shell, XQuery and XSLT. The processing of metadata, data and scripts occurs locally using Git Bash (for Windows), BaseX and Oxygen XML editor, but is essentially software-tool agnostic. Metadata input sources are e.g. OAI-PMH feeds (Datacite or METS), repository specific APIs (to get necessary file metadata) or generic command line scripts (for checksums and file sizes in some cases). Only recently we have also created a cross-sectional Digital Preservation Group at Stockholm University Library, whose first task is to create an inventory of all (external or internal) source informations systems (e.g. data repositories), together with their local destination archival or storage systems. This inventory is then aimed to serve as a basis for a digital preservation plan for future long-term preservation.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-17T14:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/5t6x01mf/","citation_pdf_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/5t6x01mf/download/pdf","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13743159","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b6uQj3CN_S_HmE4-L7B_CjWMX2WgcazRl2JAM-gTM_o/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/4ddf89491fa14b768053356fff184d51d5e1873012e04b299dadafeb331003eb"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

There are many boards that can read flux streams, including the KryoFlux, and the Award-winning Archivist’s Guide to KryoFlux (https://github.com/archivistsguidetokryoflux/archivists-guide-to-kryoflux) can help to get started. But KryoFlux is somewhat limited in the disk formats it can interpret and might be too expensive for smaller institutions. We came together as practitioners because we encountered disk formats that required additional efforts to read and extract files from. We explored hardware such as Greaseweazle and using FluxEngine software to read less common disk formats. Sharing the knowledge we have gained, this tutorial and workshop present an opportunity for participants to delve into these formats, examining them from both hardware and formatting perspectives.\n\nThe session will start with a tutorial designed to showcase various options and tools (FluxEngine, GreaseWeazle), demonstrating how to make aging equipment compatible with contemporary machines. At the end of the tutorial, participants should have the knowledge to build their own forensic workstation for 5.25” and 3.5” floppy disks. \n\nCommencing with case studies, the workshop in the second half of the session will unravel the complexities of dealing with obscure formats and share valuable lessons learned. Participants will be equipped with practical tips and tricks for identification and handling, including utilizing Hex Editors and using tools for specific obscure disk formats (such as WANG). The aim is to empower participants with the skills and knowledge needed to navigate the challenges associated with older formats.\n\nEncouraging an interactive environment, the workshop invites participants to share their experiences in tackling obscure formats. Whether seasoned professionals or newcomers to the field, everyone is welcome to contribute, fostering a collaborative exchange of insights. The inclusive nature of the workshop ensures that participants, regardless of their level of expertise, will find value in the discussions and practical demonstrations.","full_text":null,"type":"workshop","categories":null,"keywords":["information technology for dp","scaling up"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-16T11:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13828372"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Moreover, social media play a very important role in communicating about various social topics and do so by a wide range of actors. As such, the channels serve as a valuable source for (scientific) research, but, because of the volatile nature of the content, they are still rarely archived. We collaborated with KADOC-KU Leuven in the project Best Practices for the Archiving of Social Media in Flanders and Brussels, to research how to capture and archive this specific online information and make it future-proof. During the project, we tested a large number of tools, developed workflows and wrote manuals for archiving social media, and published them on our knowledge base. The manuals are written to facilitate users with little to no IT skills to start archiving social media. \n\nAn overview of the published manuals and workflows on our knowledge base:\n- [Archiving YouTube videos using Tartube](https://www.projectcest.be/wiki/Publicatie:YouTube_video%27s_archiveren_met_Tartube) \n- [Archiving social media accounts using ArchiveWeb.page](https://www.projectcest.be/wiki/Publicatie:Sociale_media_accounts_archiveren_met_ArchiveWeb.page)\n- [Workflows for capturing social media accounts](https://www.projectcest.be/wiki/Publicatie:Workflows_voor_de_captatie_van_individuele_sociale_media_accounts)\n\nThese will be translated into English before iPRES 2024.\n\nWhat will you learn?\n-----\n\nThis hands-on workshop aims to give the participants an easy way to start archiving social media accounts.

Andra, the French national radioactive waste management agency, documents its nuclear waste repositories mostly in this format, with a requirement to preserve some of this documentation over multi-century timescales at least.  The impermanence of computing and complexity of the PDF format make the latter inappropriate for such timescales, and Andra has consequently taken the route of printing these documents on permanent paper.  In the process however, in addition to the resulting high page count, digital integrity is lost which jeopardizes automated processing of text (e.g. search, translation, sorting) as it becomes dependent on the hypothetical future availability of perfect OCR.  To try and benefit from the best of both digital and analog, the Micr’Olonys solution from Eupalia, already tested at Andra on a database, was extended with a preparer utility, called Sumetar, to convert PDF files into plain UTF-8 encoded text files associated with images in the BMP format or printed in analog form.  Plain text and the BMP format are both very simple yet widespread, and are therefore suited for long term as well as current accessibility.  Sumetar packages multiple files into a single uncompressed tar file, another very simple format.  Micr’Olonys then transcribes the digital file into 2D barcodes printed on paper for passive preservation.  Tests carried out in late 2023 show that this strategy typically offers a four-fold reduction in page count for a document with roughly one image every two pages on average.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["information technology for dp","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-17T13:30:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/e8vexg58/","citation_pdf_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/e8vexg58/download/pdf","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b6uQj3CN_S_HmE4-L7B_CjWMX2WgcazRl2JAM-gTM_o/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/4ddf89491fa14b768053356fff184d51d5e1873012e04b299dadafeb331003eb"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The initial dance of negotiation between library and donor collaborations sets the tone for the ongoing relationship between the two. Across the departments in VTUL that manage such relationships with donors and curate digital collections, there are common trends emerging in barriers and observations with building relationships, and also with the concessions, compromises, and adjustments made to meet the curation needs of both parties. There are noted gaps in priorities and knowledge of curation processes, expectations around the understanding of digital collections, communication and roles and responsibilities, and resource understandability and availability. This paper specifically addresses relationships with donors and that impact on the subsequent work resulting from agreement with both parties.\n\nContinuing the iPRES conversation around community archiving and successful collaborations, the authors of this paper look critically at their partnerships with donors of digital material. This paper aligns with the conference theme “Start 2 preserve” in that it both addresses the barriers to entering the digital preservation landscape for the non-librarian community, and the barriers of digital preservation practitioners in aligning collaborator needs with digital curation needs. The authors focus on spotlighting the learning curve present on both sides of the work of community archiving. In recognizing recurrent gaps in understanding, this paper aims to be a part of a larger conversation on how community partnerships can blossom with built trust and understanding, coupled with robust planning and technical capability.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-17T13:30:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/ra23jq2d/","citation_pdf_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/ra23jq2d/download/pdf","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13840343","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mgTgU3cBnGhtUKp56WX6T09a6KFZdxdc2etEVKICP0o/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/da558afc086a4295b13f278b9880987410c0a5a02d2e45389a2e6e3f23ebcd44"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

This paper investigates a method of identification which can provide better results compared to existing methods. The Macintosh operating system used special extended attribute codes to not only identify the file type, but also the original creating application. Called Type / Creator codes, these extended attributes are often lost or hidden to the user during preservation activities but can provide important information for long term preservation.

It’s a lightweight, yet powerful instrument that is available on every computer. It allows you to manage your computer or automate repetitive tasks, but can also be used to carry out digital preservation tasks and quality control, with tools like e.g. Jhove, FFmpeg, bagIT, rclone, ExifTool, Xmlstarlet or Siegfried. Useful for every (digital) archivist whose nature of work has shifted from paper to digital. \n\nWhy use the command line?\n-------------------------\n\nThe command line is one of the most useful and efficient tools we have as computer users, but it can feel overwhelming when you first start using the tool. Small cultural heritage organisations do not always have the means to hire a full-time IT professional, requiring employees to familiarise themselves with new digital skills and tools. In our hands-on workshop, we will guide the participants in taking their first steps using the command line to carry out various digital preservation tasks.\n\nWhat will you learn?\n--------------------\nWe will dive deeper into tools for working with files in bulk:\n - validating files with Jhove or a Tiff validator;\n - transcoding videos with FFmpeg;\n - transferring files from an online storage service to an offline storage using rclone;\n- reading and writing embedded metadata in image, audio and video with ExifTool;\n- extracting information from XML files with Xmlstarlet;\n- identifying files with Siegfried;\n- packaging files in a bagIT;\n- ...\n\nThe exact list may change depending on the needs or questions of the participants. We expect to introduce 4 to 5 command line tools.\n\nThe Windows command prompt and Powershell are not compatible with the command line interface of macOS and Ubuntu. That is why Windows users need to install Microsoft’s WSL2 and set up Ubuntu before joining the workshop.\nWe will discuss the participants needs and questions in a Zoom call which will be organised around 2 weeks before the workshop.

How has higher education transformed technology? The learning experience for University students today bears very little resemblance to the experience of a student who matriculated in, say, 1970. The methods for delivering teaching, submitting assessments, and interacting with peers have completely transformed institutions of higher learning as well as the type of skills and capabilities of their graduates. These changes have contributed to a widespread transformation of the UK’s economy – indeed the global economy – which touch almost every aspect of life.\nThis paper describes a student internship at the University of Edinburgh aimed at preserving legacy issues of the University’s Computing Services’ newsletter BITs (Bulletin of IT Services). The newsletter provides unique detail about how the implementation of new technologies – like the ‘Good old Internet’ – have supported and even driven seismic change to University education. These digital archives provide rich insights into how new technologies were perceived by staff, priorities for resourcing new platforms, and the day-to-day changes to working and studying brought on by new tools and services. However, until summer 2023, many of those archives were trapped on decaying CDs and DVDs stored by the Graphic Design team.\nThrough a close collaboration between Graphic Design and Digital Archives, a student internship was developed to help recover these historic glimpses of technological innovation at the University in the late 90s and early 00s. Without resourcing for a dedicated space for forensics processing, the team assembled an ‘on-the-fly’ forensics station. Though far from ideal, the on-the-fly workstation allowed the student intern to sit with the Graphic Design team to ask questions about past projects and ways of working. Facing numerous challenges (such as training a first-year undergraduate on digital preservation, forensics software, and how to open a jewel case), this project helped to demonstrate that without dedicated funding, many important resources from across the University will be lost. However, the project also enjoyed a few highly rewarding victories, including recovery of (almost) all the legacy editions of BITs and watching a Gen Z undergraduate explain Y2K to peer student interns.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-18T16:30:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/8bppcbds/","citation_pdf_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/8bppcbds/download/pdf","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1coSQGZ5jVNK0VwwLWUyBu-JIkNkKuQH-qHnOUyj_KzA/edit#heading=h.ge8kdqo3zbiz","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/b27936ff02184e1fbce3a6cbad4e50932f2972e78ce34bdf91e5c1f936647db4"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

However, there are problems, such as delayed submission and incomplete data from publishers, that negatively impact the long-term preservation of digital science and technology resources. Therefore, it is necessary to perform a performance quality evaluation to serve as an effective means of restraint. [Method/Process] The key indicators in the long-term preservation agreement were extracted based on the implementation work. The evaluation indicators were enhanced through expert investigation to establish a performance quality evaluation system for publishers. Subsequently, the NDPC institution conducted scoring and division of levels to identify common issues and propose incentive and constraint mechanisms. [Results/Conclusion] The long-term preservation of digital science and technology resources lack robust business-oriented constraints. It is recommended to establish incentive and constraint mechanisms from combining long-term preservation to contract renewal, publicity of ranking, and data crawling authorization to urge publishers to enhance performance quality.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["governance, resourcing, and management for dp","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-18T14:40:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/rjyx4yxo/","citation_pdf_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/rjyx4yxo/download/pdf","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F5cLyxQZ6P_CkzMkoLeaZt8aSUutVAQYYU9OJt6ak7M/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/70e6a71cd819497fafd29ee52614bc920a15d919219a4c54887e6c7d5a8a3bf7"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

It is designed to promote long-term object management best practices within digital repositories. OCFL v1 was released in 2020 with a minor update to v1.1 in 2022 containing clarifications and corrections. OCFL is currently supported by the Fedora Commons Repository Platform, the InvenioRDM Platform that underlies Zenodo, LibNova products and a number of other digital preservation-oriented systems.   \n\nThis session will be divided into three sections:\n\nDesign Philosophy - The session will begin with a presentation on the history of OCFL and how the design process analysed community-provided use cases and requirements to derive a set of key objectives for OCFL. The objectives will then be examined in more detail.\n\nImplementing OCFL v1 - The presentation will be followed by a more discursive session where we will go through the OCFL v1.1 specification and accompanying Implementation Notes, and discuss how it is implemented in practice. In particular, we will look at how OCFL aims to be self-documenting and the use of the extension mechanism to expand OCFL functionality and documentability without compromising the core specification. We will also look at the available tests, fixtures and code libraries that are available to support implementers, with the opportunity for hands-on exploration.\n\nTowards v2 - The process towards a v2 release of the specification is already underway. The session will finish with a discussion of the use cases being considered for inclusion in v2 as a result of community engagements over the past 18 months and progress by the OCFL Editorial team to date, with a view to encouraging more participation and contributions.","full_text":null,"type":"workshop","categories":null,"keywords":["standards and models","from document to data"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-16T12:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Communities, groups and individuals are the prime custodians of ICH. The existing approaches and methodologies for linking data in tangible heritage cannot be practised in the context of (meta)dating ICH.\n\nDuring the project pURIs for immaterieelerfgoed.be: Building Blocks for Digital Transformation in the Cultural Heritage Sector, NGO Workshop Intangible Heritage Flandres researched how to develop a persistent and sustainable data practise for ICH. The project addressed **questions relating to the tension between the principles behind open data on the one hand, and the stewardship of communities over their living and evolving ICH on the other**. Immaterieelerfgoed.be is the platform for ICH in Flanders and Brussels. It includes inventories of ICH. The content of these inventories mainly take on the form of descriptive data and are collated through co-creation.\n\n**To achieve an ethical data practice, the rights and well-being of the ICH community involved in all phases of the data life cycle on - and beyond - immaterieelerfgoed.be have to be prioritised**. The aim is to reduce the potential harm that data sharing may cause to the communities involved, e.g. the misuse of heritage that has customary restrictions on access and use). By building upon known principles for data sharing, combining FAIR (open and persistent data sharing) and CARE (people and purposes oriented data sharing), a methodology to map the current data practice applied on immaterieelerfgoed.be has been developed. Additionally a series of actions to establish an ethical data strategy, ensuring both clean and open data and agency and advocacy of the ICH communities, has been discerned. \n\nDuring the course of the project, we scrutinised the current registration module for the ICH inventories, applied user agreements and privacy policies and the attribution of rights statements and reuse licences (e.g. Creative Commons). We researched how we can implement persistent URI’s and install an opt-out option for them without breaking their persistence. In addition we found that it is indispensable that the communities concerned have to be sensitised about the impact of sharing their data.","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["legal and social responsibilities for dp","from document to data"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-17T15:30:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13692985","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13692985","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13692985","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RnqtK66DuBgEZBSuTMC7aU8i32AMZQUp5X-Qi1AQdNg/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Others, such as Arkivum, have been implemented as hosted applications with attached cloud-storage from the start. The number of cloud-customers are growing, which means that customers on enterprise solutions must consider cloud solutions to get extra benefits or because the support for on-premise solutions will be terminated at some stage. To some organisations, this poses a major problem, since they might have institutional regulations, policies or other reasons why a cloud solution is not a possibility.\nPreservation involves both long-term access and access rights protection, and requirements will vary for different types of materials, for instance, open data versus sensitive data such as social science research data, that needs extra protection due to its nature and legal issues.\nWith cloud-based storage architectures and cloud-based services the spectrum of how things are kept safe has become more diverse than ever. Moreover, there are differences in whether the bit preservation of metadata and files is in the cloud or on-premise. \n \nThis panel will consist of representatives from organisations or projects researching and evaluating preservation solutions or using commercial solutions either on-premise or in the cloud.\nThe panel will discuss the following issues and try to learn from each other’s insights.\n \n\n·         What is the take of various heritage organisations on this development towards the cloud?\n -     Which barriers do you see in having application and/or storage in the cloud\n·         Which risks do you see when using or not using the cloud, e.g. cyber security or shut down of the solution?\n·         Which challenges or opportunities do they see in e.g. finances, maintenance, scalability? \n·         How do they envision exit strategies for cloud solutions?\n \nThe discussion will focus on the cloud questions independent of commercial solutions used by the organisations.\n\nPanelists:\nEld Zierau (KBDK)\nJeffrey van der Hoeven (KBNL)\nMicky Lindlar (TIB)\nErik Borglund (Mid Sweden University) \nAndrea Goethals (NLNZ)\nSteve Daly (TNA) \n\nModerator: \nNeil Grindley (Jisc)","full_text":null,"type":"panel","categories":null,"keywords":["information technology for dp","scaling up"],"license":"Creative Commons Zero (CC0-1.0)","date":"2024-09-17T11:30:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D_bCGeM1e4QQU8k70bQhC8X1_DBXt29StAPmeW2djmE/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/fc230dda5df941daa9a88f0bbe8b23264cdaede2ed624a2f961c1a5de67d84c6"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Understanding a file from a technical standpoint is important but equally as so is understanding the institution’s ability to preserve it for the long term. In other words, all risk is local. But how to assess that risk in a meaningful and consistent way across widely diverse collections? There is no one size fits all approach. Instead, institutions of all sizes can assess format risk in a manner that is appropriate for their organization. Two U.S. federal government agencies, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and the Library of Congress discuss their approaches to risk assessment through digital file format assessment including the similarities and differences in their approaches, which were designed to meet the different goals of their institutions. The Library of Congress utilizes a number of mechanisms including the Recommended Formats Statement, which has a defined and publicly available evaluation criteria matrix, as well as research from the Sustainability of Digital Formats. NARA issues Transfer Guidance that identifies preferred and acceptable file formats for the transfer of permanent records for preservation, as well as guidance for federal records managers about specific categories of records, such as email or social media. NARA's guidance is based on a risk assessment process for individual versions of formats, which is shared publicly through the NARA Digital Preservation Framework. Both NARA and Library of Congress’ approaches were born from a shared framework which diverged over time to meet each institution’s goals and needs.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["governance, resourcing, and management for dp","scaling up"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-17T12:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/xtwb1guc/","citation_pdf_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/xtwb1guc/download/pdf","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13750624","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18q7nGVrhTj5qLOs3b-qg74krPB0yPTA0GoltsBuA2w0/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/bd35e0d952454965a64a917ee3741564b70655a27ed640c5aad0d31be3cee8ec"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

In an attempt to scale up a work-intensive process, the authors have turned to a crowd-sourced approach, with the first step consisting of better identifying Inria's software heritage. \nMore specifically, the article discusses the outcomes of a survey sent to current and past Inria employees. Its aim was to identify landmark legacy software products of the institute, available source codes, and possible contributors to a future collective archiving effort. \nUnsurprisingly, the survey found that older software pieces are less likely to be identified, with only a small subset of early-age Inria software production being reported in the survey. The availability of associated source codes also varies, with older software being more likely to have partially or completely lost source code, or to be stored on obsolescent media. Source code from recent software however is more likely to be available on modern collaborative platforms like Github or Gitlab, ensuring safe archiving via the Software Heritage universal archive.\nIn conclusion, the Inria survey confirms the urgent need to identify and preserve historical software items, especially those from the earlier decades which are at higher risk to be definitively lost if no preservation effort is made. We believe that, due to the broad scale and breadth of this effort, the lessons learned will be of interest to other institutions and software preservation initiatives.\nAs a next step, we plan to set up a dedicated framework to empower Inria alumni to contribute to the preservation of the legacy codes, and we call on other institutions to join in this effort, paving the way for many other crowd-sourcing source code preservation initiatives.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["governance, resourcing, and management for dp","scaling up"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-17T14:10:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/hdap1420/","citation_pdf_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/hdap1420/download/pdf","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bukG4bEvICUzC-Fp3KAcHmq2wRuqU8x67PRAuX-RwR4/","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/34ffa848513a49b58e2aa3536113622690d1c56176a14334a332f184acbb8e29"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

This is a large (115 meters x 14 meters, 1610m2) painting (oil on canvas) made by two Belgian painters for the International Exhibition in Ghent (1913). It was created to propagate the Belgian involvement in Congo. Today, it is part of the collection of the War Heritage Institute in Belgium. In its lifetime it was only exhibited twice. Since its last exhibition at the Brussels’ World Fair of 1935, the painting has been in storage. Due to its scale, its material condition and the need for a large custom-built building to display it, chances the canvas itself will be exhibited in the foreseeable future are extrtemely small. This situation called for a ‘digital rescue operation’. With very few best practices for working on this scale available, the team devised a working method to unroll and photograph the canvas. Among other things, the working method included 15+ volunteers and two tanks from the Belgian Army. After months of preparation, the painting was photographed in a military warehouse by a team of photographers from the research team in December 2022. This was followed by an intensive period of stitching the 800+ images together. Next to the technical challenges of this process, we want to highlight some ethical implications of digitizing  colonial heritage. \nThe photography of the Panorama of Congo is the first work package of the FILM EU Research Innovation Transformation research pilot 'CONGO VR' (Horizon 2020).

These skills are becoming increasingly important to digital preservation, with “Computer Programming” listed as one of the skill elements in the Digital Preservation Coalition’s (DPC) Competency Framework. For those new to these skills, it can be intimidating and difficult to know where to start. The popularity of the Bits and Bots and BitCurator/DPC Python study groups are evidence of this. The contributors to this tutorial are drawn from the leadership of both programs, and have witnessed first-hand the strong desire for coding skills amongst practitioners. This tutorial aims to be a first step in their coding journey for practitioners who attend.\n \nParticipants will collaborate in groups to create a game centered around the theme of digital preservation. In the process, they will learn basic coding skills and will finish with their own interactive text based game on a shareable website. Prompts, ideas, templates and sub themes will be provided to help participants create their game. This will also have the secondary benefits of allowing participants to consider digital preservation from a different perspective, and to gain a better understanding of how websites are built and work, knowledge that will help them make more informed preservation decisions about web content.\nThe collaborative nature of the tutorial on the conference's first day presents an opportunity for participants to kick off iPRES 2024 in a fun and social way, connecting with colleagues worldwide. Sharing experiences in digital preservation often proves to be the most valuable learning experience, and this tutorial is designed to foster such knowledge exchange among participants.\n \n**Tutorial outcomes**\nBy the end of the tutorial, participants will have: \n-Fundamental coding skills \n-Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS \n-Awareness of how tools can be used to develop interactive web content \n-A game they can share and/or continue to develop (further building their skills) \n-Gained a new perspective/level of understanding of digital preservation\n-Made new connections with fellow practitioners","full_text":null,"type":"workshop","categories":null,"keywords":["information technology for dp","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-16T11:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Through collaboration and resource sharing, AIDA develops strategies and solutions for this purpose.\n\nSince the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, vast amounts of data have been stored on digital media like floppy disks, zip disks, and jaz disks. Modern workstations often cannot read them. This threatens data loss for every heritage organisation, from national archives to local historical societies.\n\nMigrating data from outdated to modern storage media is complex, and not all organisations can set up a capture station for different digital media types on their own. They must first locate suitable legacy reading equipment and then connect it to modern workstations. Additionally, they need software to transfer the complete contents of the media to contemporary storage without alterations.\n\nAIDA Capture-Lab\n----------------\n\nThe AIDA Capture-Lab is operated from the meemoo offices in Ghent and provides an obsolete data carrier capture service available for cultural heritage organisations. The capture lab was founded by AIDA in 2019 as a result of the [Digital Repair Cafe project](https://meemoo.be/en/projects/digital-repair-cafe). By bringing together and sharing resources and knowledge, data transfer is much more efficient and sustainable. All workflows and setups are documented on the [AIDA Capture Lab website](https://automatic-ingest-digital-archives.github.io/Digital-Repair-Cafe/).\n\nRODA-In\n-------\n\nWe demonstrate the process of using RODA-In to convert digital archival data into Submission Information Packages (SIPs) for ingestion into e-depots.\n\nRODA-In is a free and open-source tool which creates SIPs from local files and folders and offers features such as:\n- creating, loading, and editing classification schemas;\n- automatic association of files/folders and metadata with SIP;\n- definition of metadata templates;\n- support for various metadata formats (EAD, DC, etc.);\n- creating SIPs in various formats.\n\nAIDA hands-on\n-------------\n\nIn this tutorial, we will illustrate how to retrieve data from outdated digital media and package it into SIPs. We encourage active participation by having the audience bring their legacy media to retrieve and package data into a SIP alongside us.","full_text":null,"type":"tutorial","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-19T13:30:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZRHGDulUvWl1UDgZ4y9oJI64sRbqr_6dNtDJnQVDZ58/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The project has followed a three-phased approach of initial open-ended envisioning of an ideal repository, subsequent specification of an achievable repository, and final deployment of an operational repository. This work aims to replace the Digital Repository Service (DRS) that Harvard Library has maintained for 25 years as a highly customized homegrown preservation system. Although subject to continual enhancement over time, the DRS has now reached the effective limits of its conceptual design and operational capacity and needs to go through a generational modernization. The Library set a high benchmark for project success in terms of ten aspirational goals for support of “any” content, conditions, users, and uses.  In a departure from traditional enterprise procurement practice, the project also adopted a framework of ten “radical” transformative work principles. This framework and the insights gained from Harvard's initiative provide useful examples for other institutions considering similar programmatic change.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["information technology for dp","from document to data"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-19T14:30:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/qcch6erj/","citation_pdf_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/qcch6erj/download/pdf","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13759631","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lDWYct0heJztUyK5nOaDaLFRBO-Yx4PXT5URfiK3xZo/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/fac102093df84a8c93031824fad34cd95d7f83fd04574b0884545e07bee9e47f"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Through literature and case-study research into cultural archival practices in Flanders (Belgium), this article explores the ontological conditions preceding the practice of institutional cultural archiving. Recommendations are formulated to develop a community-oriented institutional archival practice that is responsive to how cultural memory operates, to what constitutes the community record, and to the need to not only talk with communities but also to engage in connection between communities.\n\nThree insights are presented. Firstly, the strategy of community-based archiving needs to incorporate the model of cultural archiving, emphasizing the ‘archiving’ of the community record. Secondly, a relevant and proactive institutional attitude is required that focusses through outreach on the boundary-spanning capacities of the community record, rather than on strengthening the boundary markers. Finally, an institutional cultural archival praxis is perceived as a laboratory for discussing perspectives on the making of memory and meaning, with a focus on intercommunity and intercultural recognition. Since these preconditions for implementing such a praxis are not yet met in the field, this article refrains from concrete techno-practical discussions but encourages further research and practical experiments.\n\nThe author of this article is employed at a local public archival institution in a small to medium-sized city in the Flemish region of Belgium. Additionally, the author is affiliated with the University of Antwerp, where he works on a dissertation on the role of archives in society. From the positioning that public institutional archival institutions have a societal responsibility, the article focuses on the practical implementation of the calls made by Evangelestia-Dougherty, Williams, and Punzalan","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-17T16:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/gdxzwi3z/","citation_pdf_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/gdxzwi3z/download/pdf","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13767858","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RnqtK66DuBgEZBSuTMC7aU8i32AMZQUp5X-Qi1AQdNg/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/e14395c2e38544b884534e3ad374a2f5eb92a4bb791941e1ba0222a6c969343c"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Email collections of historic value present specific acquisition challenges to collecting institutions, raising a host of technical, legal, and ethical questions. While the tools and workflows for collecting email have steadily matured in recent years, there is still little guidance on how to acquire email collections in the first place. \n\nAn independent group of archivists and records managers representing leading university libraries, international centers for email research, corporate archives, and cultural heritage organizations (with members located across the US, Canada, and the UK) formed in 2021 to discuss these issues and have been compiling good practice recommendations into a guide for the benefit of other practitioners. This guide will be released as a draft in 2024 for community feedback.\n\nThis workshop will offer participants the opportunity to connect with peers and critically evaluate the draft release of the email acquisition good practice guide. Attendees should review the draft prior to attending the workshop and arrive prepared to discuss how the report corresponds with their experience of working with email collections and its prospective usefulness for future accessioning of email. \n\nThe workshop will begin with a brief overview of the guide, its background, and a high-level summary of its recommendations. Attendees will then circulate to stations based on specific sections of the guide and brainstorm what works well and what could be improved. Remote attendees will hold discussions in a parallel set of Zoom breakout rooms correlating to each section of the guide. At the end of the small group discussions, there will be a large group recap with breakout groups reporting their takeaways in a shared Google Document.

It is designed to store, manage, and preserve digital content and is used by over 300 institutions around the world. Fedora has seen iterations over its 20+ year existence, but its core principles, focused on long-term digital preservation, have remained the same. Fedora is synonymous with stability and has long-remained a household name in the digital repository landscape.\n\nThe most recent major version of Fedora, Fedora 6.x, was released 3 years ago and there has been increasing migration efforts toward 6.x from users in outdated and unsupported older versions of the software. Fedora 6.x has sparked renewed interest in Fedora implementers because of the choice to incorporate the Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) within the persistence layer. Fedora 6.x is being well received, and new and unique use cases are being discovered regularly as the community continues to expand.\n\nThe Fedora program is committed to supporting all migration efforts to 6.x. This workshop will provide a unique opportunity for attendees to “bring their own data” and conduct a live migration with the help and assistance of the Fedora technical team. Facilitators will work alongside participants to provide suggestions, offer best practices, gather use cases, and troubleshoot in real-time. While the workshop will be focused on the Fedora migration, if time permits (and depending on the complexity of the use cases), facilitators may be able to assist with configurations with common front-end solutions like Islandora and some Samvera applications. \n\nWorkshop goals and objectives:\nIntroduce and familiarize participants with Fedora migration tools and processes.\nProvide hands-on migration assistance with real-word data (or sample data if required).\nExecute a migration to Fedora 6.x using available tooling and documentation.\nProvide attendees with detailed information on available support channels, documentation and where and how to seek assistance beyond the workshop.\n\nProposed Workshop Structure:\n1.

Those familiar, will know the number of error messages it reports. Currently, JHOVE supports different types of messages, ranging from error messages for validation failures which can indicate a problem with the file, to info messages covering everything else, e.g. too many PDF fonts for reporting. Even validation errors are varied, especially for complex file formats. In this workshop, the presenters will lend their considerable JHOVE experience to help users to analyse JHOVE error messages and diagnose problems in affected files.\n\nThe session targets beginners and practitioners. No experience in file format analysis is required of attendees. Before the workshop, we will circulate installation instructions and ask participants to bring examples of problematic files. This will allow participants to work with data and problems that feel familiar to them.\n\nWe will begin with a twenty-minute introductory session to JHOVE and its standard modules. We will then discuss the error message reports in more detail: how to interpret JHOVE messages and demonstrate the use of standard tools, like hex viewers/editors, file format standards and other file format analysis tools to find the location of errors in problematic files.  \n\nThe second part of the workshop will be hands-on, dividing the participants into small breakout groups. We will employ the techniques covered earlier to try to understand real-world error messages/file problems, using their own data or data provided by the facilitators. The presenters will moderate and assist up to three groups each, including online breakout rooms, during which we plan to engage both remote and onsite participants. \n\nThere will then be a twenty-minute session to discuss the groups’ experiences. Attendees will be encouraged to report their successes and failures, as well as provide feedback as to how JHOVE reporting might be improved. We will conclude with a ten-minute session to debrief. While this can comfortably fit in an hour and a half, it could also be extended if needed. \n\nThe minimum number of attendees would be twelve to fifteen people, but we can accommodate up to forty for this session.","full_text":null,"type":"workshop","categories":null,"keywords":["information technology for dp","scaling up"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-16T11:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Because of its characteristics a series can play an important role in the world of digital preservation.\nA series is used to describe information and to provide the relevant context. Additionally, it is used to establish certain management rules on inventory and contextualization, acquisition and disposal, access and consultation, preservation and destruction. The biggest advantage gained from this concept, is that rules on appraisal are not imposed upon file or record level, but upon series level. As a result, information is already given an retention period and appraised at a high level.\nThis paper starts with an insight into what a series is and how it functions in the Series Register.

Decentralized and decoupled versions of value-adding services such as overlay journals, peer review, and endorsement services are provided to the network. These alternatives address not only the massive monopolization of scholarly communication but also new demands for rapid distribution of scholarly artifacts in fields such as life sciences. They also accommodate new publication formats, such as data sets and source code that are beyond the traditional paper. Event Notifications provide an asynchronous point-to-point messaging protocol that acts as an interoperability layer between the nodes in such networks. Event Logs are a proposal to provide full transparency in the scholarly process by publishing public resources on each node containing lifecycle information pertaining to the scholarly artifacts in the network. Trust in Event Logs requires some form of machine verifiability because trust by reputation of each node is not scalable in large networks. This paper presents a pragmatic approach to building trust without relying on costly blockchain technologies, which lack sustainable long-term strategies. By using trusted archival nodes within Event Notification networks and Event Logs, we propose a decentralized, transparent, and trustworthy alternative to traditional scholarly communication systems.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["standards and models","from document to data"],"license":"Creative Commons Zero (CC0-1.0)","date":"2024-09-19T11:30:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/479f9vcn/","citation_pdf_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/479f9vcn/download/pdf","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hf-VavCLYwGskk3JdDbnPOALZtP2Yd4w2pe_5Evkxg8/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/95ca2a083ac641f99b58185549d7c5407e49ac128c9e45efb96d32698a8f023a"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

That call was given fresh impetus in 2023 by Sherry Williams and Ricky Punzalan who further articulated the barriers and benefits of community-engaged preservation. This panel progresses that discussion through the lens of ‘post-custodial’ approaches to digital preservation for ‘community-generated digital content’. ‘[Post-custodial][2]’ in this context refers to efforts that empower community centered data creators to preserve their own content when traditional memory institutions are not available or appropriate.  \n\nThe panel emerges from the ‘Our Heritage Our Stories’ project which has explored the challenges of sustaining a large number of small-scale, community-based digitization initiatives in the UK.  It draws on research, current practice, and case studies to propose a post-custodial toolkit for community generated digital content.  The toolkit is designed to improve the preservation outcomes of data classed as ‘[critically endangered][3]’ in the 2023 Global List of Endangered Digital Species. \n\nPost-custodial approaches are not devoid of problems.  For example, what is the appropriate relationship between community-driven approaches and existing memory institutions?  Do they undermine well established workflows; and how much is gained in return? How do we enable participatory metadata creation and management?  What technical steps are needed? How to resolve disputed meanings and contested access within preservation practice? How do post-custodial approaches relate to decolonization? Is there alignment with emerging expectations of indigenous data sovereignty in countries colonized by the West? What can be learned from the indigenous data sovereignty movement to enable community ownership of digital materials by marginalized or precarious groups in colonizing nations?\n\nThis lively panel will introduce and review post-custodial models of digital preservation and set them in a global perspective.  It will provoke comment from practitioners from different contexts, including from Aotearoa / New Zealand where data sovereignty principles have been impactful in the protection of land, culture and knowledge. Thus, the panel will maintain momentum through two previous iPres conferences while anticipating themes which are certain to arise in the next. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDEWqey559M\n  [2]: https://dictionary.archivists.org/entry/postcustodial.html\n  [3]: https://www.dpconline.org/digipres/champion-digital-preservation/bit-list/critically-endangered/bitlist-community-generated-content","full_text":null,"type":"panel","categories":null,"keywords":["legal and social responsibilities for dp","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Zero (CC0-1.0)","date":"2024-09-17T14:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13742764","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mgTgU3cBnGhtUKp56WX6T09a6KFZdxdc2etEVKICP0o/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/da558afc086a4295b13f278b9880987410c0a5a02d2e45389a2e6e3f23ebcd44"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

We will share how the CLOCKSS archive approached this, including how and when we engaged key stakeholders along the way, and explore ways that this could be generalised to be more broadly applicable throughout the international digital preservation community.\n\nCLOCKSS began by setting out to find friends who could help us find a path. We were so lucky to find colleagues involved in the DIMPACT Project (https://dimpact.org/about). The DIMPACT community is focused on calculating and ultimately reducing the carbon footprint of digital communication and media companies and includes publishers such as Cambridge University Press, Elsevier, Institute of Physics Publishing, Oxford University Press, and Taylor & Francis.\n\nWe began by developing a component/functional map of our digital archive, and documenting:\n1) The component parts of the system \n2) At a high level, how these components work \n3) How and where the service is used\n\nOur aim was to unpack the ‘preservation’ black box that was part of the broader DIMPACT project diagram for all of digital publishing. \n \nThe next step was to:\n \n1.     Identify the significant energy-using components used to provide, maintain and deliver the preservation service and where each component was geographically located.

How do we learn about the formats and software we care for? How can we find the information we need to improve our workflows and services? Since at least 2004 [1], the iPRES community has been well aware of the need to address this challenge together. But in the years since then, a succession of projects and proposals have come and gone [2], undermined by the institutional and financial constraints we operate under. Given the realities of the situation, how can we improve our digital preservation practices?\n\nThe \"Registries of Good Practice\" Project is a two-year collaboration between the Digital Preservation Coalition and Yale University Library, aiming to explore new ways to make the most of the sources of practical knowledge we have, without demanding large-scale change or expensive infrastructure. This workshop will present our prototypes for searching across format registries and for finding relevant publications, our approach to sustainable design and our vision for building a shared understanding of the landscape of registries and records relevant to digital preservation.\n\nThis will be followed by hands-on exploration of our new tools, to help attendees understand the range and coverage of the available registries, and learn new ways to find relevant records of technology and practice. This will help us to gather the user feedback that is critical to the success of the project and steer our future work. We will also use this workshop to document the wide range of records and registries that the digital preservation community depends on. This will help us build a better shared understanding of the current state of digital preservation, and of the wider landscape of information sources that we can all take advantage of and contribute to.\n\n[1] Aschenbrenner, Andreas. ‘File Format Registries - a Global Infrastructure for Local Persistence’.

Research data ecosystems like the HDE provide a central data-discovery portal (similar to a data catalog); however, ecosystem architecture design relies on independently-managed data repositories with disparate architectures and governance frameworks. These types of systems tend not to fit neatly into existing digital sustainability frameworks such as the NDSA Levels of Preservation. In addition, most digital preservation literature tends to focus on the sustainability of *centralized* data archives rather than *distributed* data ecosystems. We propose that the sustainability of distributed research ecosystems may be evaluated by integrating concepts from existing digital preservation assessment frameworks standards that, in combination, address many of the digital sustainability factors that apply to organizational, repository, and dataset levels of granularity within a distributed system. We experiment with two such possible frameworks. First, the Digital Preservation Coalition’s Rapid Assessment model includes several metrics that cover organizational/repository *architecture and governance* and could be extended to apply to a distributed data ecosystem. Second, the relatively recent FAIR data principles provide guidance for evaluating ecosystem practices at the *dataset level*. This exploratory paper aims to spark discussion and additional research around how best to create and implement efficient frameworks for evaluating digital sustainability in a data ecosystem that depends on non-centralized architecture and governance.","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["governance, resourcing, and management for dp","scaling up"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-17T13:25:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13754346","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13754346","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13754346","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bukG4bEvICUzC-Fp3KAcHmq2wRuqU8x67PRAuX-RwR4/","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/34ffa848513a49b58e2aa3536113622690d1c56176a14334a332f184acbb8e29"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The workshop is for anyone preserving complex works (or interested in doing so) that may need to assess their preservability. It is especially relevant to those who interface with content creators and have opportunities to give feedback to improve preservation outcomes - for example, those working with digital humanities researchers.\n\nThe tool is being developed from five years of research into the preservability of new forms of scholarship (i.e., complex works characterized by the variety of digital enhancements such as audio, video, data visualizations, nonlinear navigation, etc., that are integrated alongside or in lieu of text). For this research, preservation experts [worked with publishers/platforms][1] and [evaluated complex publications][2] to determine their risk factors for preservability. From this they suggested [interventions (“Guidelines”) to reduce risks][3] based on preservation method (web archiving, export etc.) and format. \n\nThe research identified a need to share advice about improving preservability of scholarship with content creators in an actionable way. The Self Assessment Tool aims to meet this need. The tool uses a process workflow that unfolds over several conversations. It includes a set of questions and access points into the Guidelines.\n\nThe workshop will start with a short introduction to the Self Assessment Tool, highlighting scenarios from the research that illustrate features that can be difficult to preserve alongside relevant guidance for those scenarios. In small groups, participants will then test facets of the tool working through questions, identifying risks, and mapping them to suggested interventions from the Guidelines. Attendees are encouraged to bring their own examples of scholarly works with preservation challenges and to explore the Guidelines, considering how they might be implemented to improve preservability. \n\nFinally, team members will lead a conversation about attendees’ experiences working with the tool, seeking insights into areas for improvement, and an understanding of how useful the tool could be for the communities with whom they work.\n\n\n  [1]: https://guides.nyu.edu/blog/The-Andrew-W-Mellon-Foundation-Awards-NYU-502400-For-Libraries-Project-to-Expand-Capabilities-F\n  [2]: https://archive.nyu.edu/handle/2451/63332\n  [3]: https://preservingnewforms.dlib.nyu.edu/","full_text":null,"type":"workshop","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","from document to data"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-16T14:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Regarding institutional repositories, the guarantee of the longevity of digital content is most often weakened by the lack of this documentation. Therefore, we understand that Distributed Digital Preservation is a reliable alternative to mitigating the lack of policies and other risk agents. This paper presents an overview of digital preservation policies in institutional repositories of the LOCKSS networks community. This article identified the structure and grip of digital preservation policies to ISO 14721 and 16363 standards guidelines. Eleven LOCKSS networks were identified, 610 partner institutions were investigated, resulting in the identification of 184 institutional repositories and 40 digital preservation policy documents. Digital Preservation Policy is an essential document so that the promise of guaranteeing the longevity of digital objects stored in the Institutional Repository can be fulfilled. In this context, using the framework structure for digital preservation policies, identified on the websites of institutions in the LOCKSS networks, expands the scope of the domain of managing the preservation of digital content in Institutional Repositories.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Zero (CC0-1.0)","date":"2024-09-17T12:10:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/2u7go804/","citation_pdf_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/2u7go804/download/pdf","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q7uNrEVGePdeRV2G9qDrO4AfNgIr2YY_xpKU99e61Yo/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/33b18535dd5843ffb8f79c836fadf7895bec43f73c7f4e4682ff38249050ad85"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Prompted by these events, the State Archives of Belgium embarked on a mission to identify measures to safeguard the nation's collective memory – increasingly shaped by alternative archive types like mobile messages – and to ensure accountability of elected officials in both the short and long term. This paper outlines the findings of this endeavor. After a brief introduction and summary on the emergence of text and instant messaging as pivotal communication tools, we first assess their suitability for policy-making dialogue. Then follows an exploration of the preservation challenges the medium presents, both in a general context and specifically within Belgium, and of some strategies that can be employed to mitigate these challenges. In the conclusion, we summarise and put forward additional steps that archives can take to ensure the preservation of text messages by political officeholders, and briefly contemplate on the disclosure of these messages to the public in the short and long run.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","from document to data"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-19T11:50:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/sx4wh6o5/","citation_pdf_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/sx4wh6o5/download/pdf","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vwv6zUEo9Ghea51byXz0bIjTsi-y9VwoVMpHc0byzv4/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/0f216093b1c44efb9765c5fd30b0de776ef5b769fd03410182512a1e78a674e5"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Thrown in at the deep end and left to get on with it. How hard can it be? You’ve just got to look after the digital ”stuff”… \n\nand keep it usable… \n\nand not lose it… \n\nand describe it… \n\nand make sure what you’re doing is legal… \n\nand… \n\nand… \n\nand…\n\nHmmm. Perhaps not so easy.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n![Some time later][1]\n\n There's been an Oops. Big or small. It doesn’t matter. What does matter is that, with the benefit of hindsight, it could have been avoided. And to make it worse, someone just shared the immortal line “I could have told you that would happen.”\n\nThis panel session is intended to surface as many of those “Oops! If only…” scenarios as possible, and then let the panel/audience decide which of these are the most important to be aware of for those **Starting 2 Preserve** .\n\nWe see this as an interactive panel session utilising the expertise of up to 7 authorities from the field of Digital Preservation and related disciplines. Each will be asked to briefly put forward an anecdote / point of view / opinion relating to most important nugget of Digital Preservation wisdom they wish they’d known before they started. The statements will be followed by a series of questions designed to explore those scenarios further. \n\nThe audience will be invited to participate (and contribute their own “if only...” scenarios) through a series of questions/observations from the floor (both those in attendance and those attending virtually). In particular, the audience will be polled at the end of the session to see what they think is(are) the most important thing(s) the past can warn future Digital Preservation practitioners about.\n\nThis is the third in a series of panel discussions that have taken place it iPres over the past two years. Although presented in a light hearted fashion, we see this as a particularly useful way of surfacing the common pitfalls experienced by those taking their first steps into Digital Preservation that could have been avoided… if only someone had told them.\n\n\n  [1]: https://78.media.tumblr.com/13765181be5a9e444a7b4e4bc8ed19b4/tumblr_pc4rqoskHi1u6nopoo2_1280.jpg","full_text":null,"type":"birds of a feather","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-17T11:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vZPyik_30l7oT7bFl1eN0X-UGWpFax5GvlccQ6scLEs/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The DPC/TNA Novice to Know-How course and its ongoing development is a salient example. This poster uses interactive and asynchronous engagement to call on digital preservation community educators and policymakers to include individuals and community groups when developing “start 2 preserve” initiatives. This poster’s call is supported with empirical findings that contribute to the emerging issue of democratizing digital preservation skills amongst these groups in the UK. \n\nUsing in-poster links to audiovisual evidence, the poster presents findings from two doctoral, qualitative, research projects. One project researched self-tracking personal digital archives, and the other researched activist community web archives. The first project used mobile and virtual data collection methods, researching eight members of the public who used self-tracking records to create personal digital archives of their running history. The second project used interviews and participant diaries to understand the engagement of UK activist-archives with web archiving also including data from Documenting the Now, the UK Web Archive and the Community Archives and Heritage Group. \n\nThe poster discusses the findings in relation to the need to democratize digital preservation skills. Activist archives recognise the need for digital preservation skills but there is a skills gap for runners' personal digital archives. Runners often lack digital preservation knowledge and rely on third-party platforms. Both studies highlighted the need to empower individuals and activist communities to preserve digital content beyond commercial platforms through educational resources and capacity building. Empowerment through democratized digital preservation education could enable individuals and activist communities to make informed choices about their digital legacies and respect their agency to contribute to safeguarding further a shared digital heritage for future generations. \n\nThis poster, with asynchronous digital learning tools, provides new knowledge about the digital preservation skills from the UK public and activist community groups. The poster wants to open a conversation with the international digital preservation community to help those wanting to get started with digital preservation to meet their personal and community digital archive needs.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["legal and social responsibilities for dp","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-17T13:30:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13711158","citation_pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MmsZS9IP_iPshz1rlL_IBYyPN-7mGSeK/view?usp=drive_link"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}
{"title":"Digital Preservation of Indigenous Knowledge in Ramat Library, University of Maiduguri; Nigeria","url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/ipres/ipres-2024/papers/digital-preservation-of-indigenous-knowledge-in-ramat-library-un/","creators":["Usman Ibrahim"],"abstract":"It is discerned from literature that digitally preserving indigenous knowledge in the context of climate change is particularly important because indigenous communities often possess unique understandings and strategies for managing natural resources and responding to environmental changes. Their knowledge can provide valuable insights into sustainable living and adaptation strategies that are crucial in the face of global climate change. Owing to the risk of losing oral history and indigenous knowledge due to climatic changes and displacements resulting from conflicts in the Northeast of Nigeria, this study set out with the overall aim of creating a condition where indigenous knowledge is digitized and is securely maintained for the present and future generations. This attempt was made through the assessment of organisational capacity of Ramat Library by utilising the Digital Preservation Coalition Rapid Assessment Model (DPC RAM). This research proposes using the six elements of the DPC RAM as a basis for beginning the evaluation and progression towards sustainable digital preservation of indigenous knowledge regarding climate change adaptation. The Ramat Library at the University of Maiduguri was utilized for the practical application. The findings in this paper shows that there are fundamental issues hampering the digital preservation of indigenous knowledge. Some of these issues are policy related, lack of technical literacy by library staff members and poor collaboration between Library and wider community amongst others.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-18T14:30:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/o5shuj0u/","citation_pdf_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/o5shuj0u/download/pdf","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MToYP8iGZoTWR3l_d6IHQm8iNRXr1ozm5lJNA9ercLM/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/3ec04ee9969c4ac48501aa9100cd6f752a2085cce7cc414588e4c6fc22f07e98"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

To ensure the reliable implementation of NDPP's preservation work, NDPP is dedicated to building a learning-oriented team that can adapt to the evolving technical and skill requirements in digital preservation. Therefore, NDPP has established a comprehensive training framework encompassing six areas of knowledge content and ten different training activities. This framework is designed to provide targeted training for the NDPP work teams and to facilitate inter-institute communication and cooperation.\nNDPP analyzed the team's capability requirements based on the business process to form a framework. Based on the survey of the capability backgrounds of team members and combined with practical needs, an NDPP digital preservation knowledge system covering six areas was built, which included the field of digital preservation knowledge, operational skills, technology and development, resource planning and preservation rights, communication and collaboration, and continuous learning.\nThe training methods include specialized courses for skills and knowledge enhancement, academic salons for scholarly discussion, practical simulations for hands-on experience, and issue discussions for problem-solving. NDPP also utilizes modern platforms such as a WeChat official account for information dissemination and a project website for resource sharing, which includes ongoing updates, training materials, and research findings. Bi-monthly bulletins and annual research reports are produced to keep the team informed of global advancements in the field. At the same time, nationwide academic conferences and open days promote broader cooperation and understanding of digital preservation. Educational handbooks and promotional materials are produced to increase public recognition of the importance of digital preservation.\nBased on this framework, the NDPP has developed a plan for training activities in 2024, after which feedback will be collected and the framework improved. NDPP will continue to expand training for business management teams and strengthen alliance cooperation in digital preservation in China.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["governance, resourcing, and management for dp","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-18T14:20:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/58wecn1d/","citation_pdf_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/58wecn1d/download/pdf","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F5cLyxQZ6P_CkzMkoLeaZt8aSUutVAQYYU9OJt6ak7M/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/70e6a71cd819497fafd29ee52614bc920a15d919219a4c54887e6c7d5a8a3bf7"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Long-term negative maintenance of legacy systems threatens the security and availability of historical data, and also brings economic and technical burdens. In the Chinese context, this article first concludes the requirements triangle which means the public sectors' need to rescue historical data of legacy systems lies in three aspects: data long-term preservation, data used as evidence and data sharing and utilization. Based on a review of the relevant literature, this paper categorizes the existing approaches related to legacy systems into a two-dimensional matrix with four quadrants according to the degree of technological and functional change. Building on these approaches, and in order to further meet the requirements triangle, this article suggests a Chinese solution - data archiving, which is based on China's institutional background and archive management demands. Data archiving incorporates the comprehensive archives into the process of solving legacy system problems, takes advantage of the expertise of archives in long-term preservation of resources, and finally satisfies the requirements triangle. It can be concluded that the practice of data archiving simultaneously brings value to organizations plagued by legacy systems, to comprehensive archives and to the data itself.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","from document to data"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-19T14:15:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/pans1rzp/","citation_pdf_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/pans1rzp/download/pdf","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TyATX9tJYvyL0Wx572QwHZp_tsNIPyhOnbkEfnzDWsg/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/227a2716e87940519b21037d2c2726849f6e82d457d340e6926ae7ec5534600c"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

This surge presents unparalleled challenges for research libraries and cultural heritage organizations, the traditional custodians of petabyte-scale digital collections, as they grapple with preserving cultural memory amidst this zettabyte era. This research article delves into the shifting landscape of digital storage, scrutinizing the immense volumes of data emanating from academic, healthcare institutions, and notably, national laboratories and scientific hubs, exemplified by the pioneering work at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF). The study seeks to understand the repercussions of this digital onslaught on libraries' preservation mandates, probing which data merits preservation, what might be irretrievably lost, and the adaptive measures necessary for the enduring safeguarding of cultural memory. In light of these challenges, the narrative evolves to contemplate future-oriented solutions. Specifically, the emergent technology of Ceramic Nano Memory emerges as a promising contender, with the potential to revolutionize data storage. This innovation is on the cusp of redefining the parameters of density, performance, access, cost, and sustainability in data centers, heralding a scalable trajectory into the Yottabyte Era. Ceramic Nano Memory's advent could significantly mitigate current constraints, offering a new vista for research libraries to navigate the complexities of digital preservation, ensuring their pivotal role in the continuum of cultural heritage is not just maintained but invigorated in the face of burgeoning data landscapes.","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","from document to data"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-19T13:30:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13698003","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13698003","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13698003","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lDWYct0heJztUyK5nOaDaLFRBO-Yx4PXT5URfiK3xZo/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/fac102093df84a8c93031824fad34cd95d7f83fd04574b0884545e07bee9e47f"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

In fact, electronic records are encoded in the most diverse file formats (text, still images, audio and video recordings, technical records and many other digital media formats), but they are bound to become rapidly obsolete (and in some cases already are) and need to be converted from one file format to another in order to preserve the authenticity, reliability, integrity and usability of such records as evidence of business functions, processes, activities and transactions.\n\nConsequently, the challenge of identifying when file formats need to be converted, which formats to choose for conversion, and which approaches to apply from an operational point of view begins to emerge.\n\nHowever, despite being theorized as one of the most successful digital preservation solutions, format conversion has not yet been sufficiently practiced. Even when the need to transfer electronic records from an obsolete format to a more modern one is adequately felt, the process is often delayed due to a lack of knowledge and expertise, as well as a lack of clear and precise guidelines and advice on how to carry out the conversion, including technical and operational methods.\n\nThis paper aims to address this issue by referring both to the international standards and guidelines and on the Italian “Guidelines on the creation, management and preservation of electronic documents”, issued by the Italian Agency for Digital Government (in particular with reference to”) and in particular will focus on the operational methodology for file format conversion contained in Annex 2 “File formats and conversion”","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","scaling up"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-17T13:50:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/oswmkgvc/","citation_pdf_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/oswmkgvc/download/pdf","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bukG4bEvICUzC-Fp3KAcHmq2wRuqU8x67PRAuX-RwR4/","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/34ffa848513a49b58e2aa3536113622690d1c56176a14334a332f184acbb8e29"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

How interesting then, that in the past decade, numerous independent initiatives in at least ten different countries have organically sprung up to fill this void. In every case, it's a small team, even a single person, whose passion for local history and archival photographs, and knowledge of web development, has led them to digitize historical photos, develop digital heritage portals, and create communities revolving around local history and collective memory. These cooperative history portal initiatives are surprisingly technologically innovative–offering sophisticated timeline, mapping, geolocation, crowd-source tagging, search/exploration, public discussion, and photo-matching tools that allow people from a particular place or country to explore historical photos most relevant to them, and to add their local expertise. These initiatives are also refreshingly innovative in terms of user experience and aesthetics, and have much to teach digital preservation communities about increasing and enlivening public engagement with historical photos. \nThis panel presentation will present ten examples of cooperative photo history portal initiatives that have emerged independently in ten different countries:  Austria (Topotheque), Chile (Enterrano), Estonia (Ajapaik), Hungary (Fortepan), Israel (Dokuforte), Malta (MagnaZmien), Romania (Azopan), Russia (Pastvu), Switzerland (NotreHistoire), and USA (Fortepan US). Until recently, our projects have been doing synchronized swimming in parallel pools. However, we have recently found each other through various Creative Commons and individual outreach initiatives, and we decided to hold our first consortium meeting in summer 2023. Since then, we are meeting regularly and have created OPAN–the Open Portal Archive Network (https://opanglobal.org). Our goal is to share our practices and experiences, build open source sustainable code (to share), find other similar initiatives in other countries, raise awareness of the interest and importance of private family archives and the history of everyday people, and create a mosaic of open portal archives to preserve and make publicly available the world’s vernacular photos. \nWe hope to present the myriad ways in which our individual efforts are inspiring people to engage in shared public memory, and find ways in which the digital preservation community can benefit from our work.","full_text":null,"type":"birds of a feather","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-18T15:25:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16S5qwg42Mjnxe22cdVxZH63tVCVMgs-m92o02THSgC4/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/b208d828f7d0472f91d594fd9a1e7e1068f37cdd5e09419d8e7f69a4eb27e3fb"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}
{"title":"Meeting the Digital Preservation Needs of Smaller Organizations","url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/ipres/ipres-2024/papers/meeting-the-digital-preservation-needs-of-smaller-organizations/","creators":["Jefferson Bailey"],"abstract":"The practice of digital preservation tends to be well-established at larger institutions such as academic research libraries, governments and NGOs, and other well-resourced organizations. However, in aggregate the bulk of cultural heritage materials, including those in digital form, are held by the tens of thousands of smaller organizations dedicated to preserving local memory collections such as public libraries, historical societies, regional museums, and community archives. These smaller organizations are also more focused on preserving the lives and accomplishments of everyday citizens and local history -- collection building that greatly diversifies the archival record well beyond the institutional self-documentation or collections of famous/entitled people that tend to characterize the collections of larger organizations. Since 1996, Internet Archive (IA) has worked with over 1,500 organizations both big and small to provide digital archiving and preservation services, tools, expertise, advocacy, training and open-source technologies. In 2023, IA launched the Vault digital preservation service to better meet the needs of institutions, including smaller ones, that require an affordable, extensible, mission-aligned, non-profit digital preservation service option. In this paper/presentation, we will outline the many lessons learned from extensive discussion, research, needs assessment, and practical experience, both from the perspective of the institutions themselves and from the perspective of building a non-profit software-as-a-service platform that aims to meet the needs of the smaller LAM community. The paper will detail findings on the various challenges of doing digital preservation at smaller organizations, including financial/budgetary realities, issues of staffing and policy, technology capacity limitations, and overall program management and sustainability challenges. The paper will then describe how these challenges were addressed in product development, cost modeling, and community cultivation in building a digital preservation service that incorporates these findings into its service design. Finally, the paper will propose various strategies for digital preservation practices and community building to be more inclusive of smaller organizations and ways that the larger community can collectively empower smaller organizations to help advance the global digital preservation effort.","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["information technology for dp","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-18T15:15:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13863851","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13863851","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13863851","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16S5qwg42Mjnxe22cdVxZH63tVCVMgs-m92o02THSgC4/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/b208d828f7d0472f91d594fd9a1e7e1068f37cdd5e09419d8e7f69a4eb27e3fb"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

It has moved away from using an on-premise Electronic Document and Records Management System (EDRMS) with data stored on network and personal drives; to a cloud-based Office 365 environment with the teams from both Houses storing and sharing data in OneDrive and SharePoint. This move created a need for a solution to transferring information of archival value out of its cloud based collaborative platform and into long-term storage and preservation whilst retaining the context within which they were created.\nTransfer of information is complicated by the nature of cloud-based collaboration and storage in several ways. Firstly, when files can be viewed, edited, stored and shared by multiple users concurrently, it can be difficult to establish what the authoritative version of a file is. Secondly, with the proliferation of user applied metadata tags and labels, the context in which the files were created form as much a part of the archival record as the files themselves. Thirdly, there is the question of how to validate and authenticate files extracted from the cloud.\nThe preservation of this data moves away from preserving just the individual file to capturing the file and its contextual metadata. This paper describes the Parliamentary Archives efforts to explore and test the transfer and authentication archival data from the cloud and into their digital repository.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","from document to data"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-18T12:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/d18g1vbe/","citation_pdf_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/d18g1vbe/download/pdf","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FD-lIrViKGWNpBR8inlhbkoudzx4OqY7IM5C7anGIn0/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/3c201d717da7420295f0ae90d0b0b1e9787aeff96d2548fb8552074190b13848"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Improvements in the ability to identify, select, capture and replay these archived web resources are helping many organizations to meet their missions of preservation and access in the digital world.  With this increase of archived web resources, additional methods of analyzing large amounts of data are needed to understand the complexity of these collections and help make accurate preservation decisions about the content.\n\nThe Parquet format is an open source, column-oriented data file format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. It has implementations in a variety of programming languages and acts as a standardized way of storing large datasets in many big data and distributed storage and analysis applications. It excels in the storage of tabular data with repeated values that are often queried to identify counts, sums, and unique sets of values. \n\nTo demonstrate the potential for Parquet files to be used in analyzing web archives, we will use the End of Term (EOT) Web Archive as a data testbed for this tutorial. The EOT has been gathering snapshots of the federal web, consisting of the publicly accessible \".gov\" and \".mil\" websites since 2008. In 2022, the End of Term team packaged these crawls into a public dataset which they released as part of the Amazon Open Data Sponsorship Program. In total, over 460TB of WARC data was moved from local repositories at the Internet Archive and the University of North Texas Libraries. The EOT team generated Parquet files for the contents of each term's web crawls to allow for large-scale analysis of content and to answer questions about the data that previously had been challenging or impossible to answer.\n\nIn this tutorial we will bring a hands-on experience for the participants to analyze a substantial web archive collection. The tutorial will include introduction to some existing archival collection summarization tools like CDX Summary and Archived Unleashed Toolkit, the process of converting CDX(J) files to Parquet files, numerous SQL queries to analyze those Parquet files for practical and common use-cases, and visualization of generated reports.","full_text":null,"type":"tutorial","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","from document to data"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-19T11:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/170qoj-FuFfEnuWsbQPVZTzK88PUp4rAARYXsR4WUD30/edit#heading=h.2sh8zqpg4185"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

One, because it’s fun, and two, because this is a story about time travel, collaboration, and rescue. For decades, the Doctor has been traveling through time to perform quirky and creative rescue missions. Like historical datasets, each adventure presents unique challenges, but one thing remains constant: the Doctor works best with others, and the same is true of data rescue, which requires expertise in archives, data, and the related subject matter. Discovering usable, historical data in an archives can feel as delightful and magical as the best episodes of Doctor Who. It can also be as tedious and frustrating as the worst episodes, but like all good science fiction, even the worst bits pose illuminating questions.\n\nHow do current concepts of data and scholarship compare to historical ones? How do we find data that wasn’t labeled as data? How do we find data that wasn’t *thought of* as data? Once we find archival data, how do we transform it for reuse and analysis? What can historical data teach us about current best practices for documentation and vice versa?  Our research questions and knowledge structures determine what data will be acquired, how it will be arranged and analyzed, and also through what mechanisms it will be interpreted in the archives. Understanding all of this is integral to understanding how the data can be reused.\n\nThis panel discussion will bring together archivists, librarians, and data service specialists to share their experiences finding, stewarding, and using data in archives - the successes, frustrations, discoveries, pitfalls, and unanswered questions. Together, we will explore possible solutions to the challenges of bridging data science and archives such as: identifying search terms that might indicate data; inferring missing context about standard research practices at the time data was collected; finding data in unexpected places like annotations and correspondence; working across datasets while preserving document order and fragile materials; extracting data from handwritten narrative text, symbols, and drawings; working through historical challenges like species names that change over time; and, making human-readable data machine-readable.","full_text":null,"type":"panel","categories":null,"keywords":["information management principles","from document to data"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-19T14:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13770146","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mghp5CLQs5hveGd3YOoAoi-bIrSSuzckv1-Ta70hiH8/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/da2d1b9b4b1f4d30bdfe6ee2f5e1578774244bbbdd7b4374b3caa268caec75fe"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

From the NEDLIB project in the 90s of the twentieth century, the worldwide first operational e-Depot in accordance with the OAIS standard in 2002, to important contributions to international research in digital preservation in the first years of the twenty-first century. KBNL shared its successes and knowledge with the digital preservation community by means of papers, professional visits and conferences. \nBut at a certain point in time KBNL became a bit quiet, and remained quiet for a while.

In my opinion, it is of interest to know what the “embodied experience” is like from a practical point of view, and the personal perspective is important because preservation is more than just policy. Although sharing honest stories in public is, unfortunately, not usually an option, we think it’s important to be open to the community about our challenges, and things that have not gone as well as we liked, so we can all learn from those experiences and move forward together.\n\n“Many times what we perceive as an error or failure is actually a gift.

The Keiyo as an ethnic group are a people who feel connected by a complex mix of kinship, culture, and history.\nKeiyo History Culture And Heritage (KHCH) Centre has embraced the challenge of scanty community historical and cultural records. One of the goals in its workplan is to create a digital platform repository for the uniquely rich history, culture and heritage of the Keiyo Community. With the already thriving partnerships and collaborations with actors in the global North, Kenya and indeed Africa shall overcome the challenges facing its desire to bridge the gabs in the realization of equity in matters preservation and dissemination of its priceless ages-old indigenous knowledge driven rich history culture and heritage.","full_text":null,"type":"paper","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-17T16:40:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/mp5h8q05/","citation_pdf_url":"https://ipres2024.pubpub.org/pub/mp5h8q05/download/pdf","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QaM-23veDJpSDV0c31avxpj7N9yzi82UpA5LXQjgyRM/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/32af20969ae4432e92ec34b4858d646eb0bc0e923d964404a63fd266c97ef4ee"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The process included physical cleaning of disks, and resulted in over 90% of data being recovered and preserved. \n\nThe preservation of born-digital materials begins well before they reach any archival institution. Records created in the 1990s and 2000s are often “saved” on removable storage media by their creators, and the longevity of those media is affected by their storage conditions. Institutions collecting private records must deal with these effects only at the time the records come to us.\n\nIn 2023, the Lakehead University Archives began acquiring records donated by Steve Mantis, a long-time activist and advocate for the rights of injured and disabled workers. The records in his fonds reflect close to 40 years of organising. \n\nMantis’s records were stored in a hand-built outbuilding on his rural property. This two-story structure serves as a garage and home office, and is not insulated, heated, or air conditioned. There has been no water damage, and excellent air circulation has prevented any mould or mustiness. However, records in the building have been subjected to significant temperature swings (over a possible range of 80 degrees celsius) and insects have not been excluded.\n\nThe donation of records included just under 200 floppy disks. Work began with a full cleaning of all disks, including moving and checking under the shutters. Cobwebs and insect remains were removed carefully. Only then was it possible to transfer the information from the disks and prepare SIPs for ingest. Despite the storage environment, most disks were still in good condition. \n\nDigital preservation may often be talked about in the abstract, but case-studies like this demonstrate the very real material and practical challenges to preservation that are faced by small archives that comprise an important piece of local and regional heritage. This case also demonstrates how removable digital media may be more resilient to temperature extremes and other environmental challenges than one might expect.","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-17T15:40:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13737775","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13737775","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13737775","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RnqtK66DuBgEZBSuTMC7aU8i32AMZQUp5X-Qi1AQdNg/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/e14395c2e38544b884534e3ad374a2f5eb92a4bb791941e1ba0222a6c969343c"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Traditional Circumcision (kaja) practice and ceremony which is a cultural heritage of the Kanuri people of Northeastern Nigeria is a rite of passage for young boys into adulthood. Presently, this practice stands the risk of fading away completely due to the mass displacement resulting from the Boko Haram conflict. The affected indigenous Kanuri communities are on the verge of loosing their sense of place and opportunity to express their cultural values and traditional knowledge. Currently we have tried to use various social media platforms through Communities of Practice to bring elders together and the youth in order to capture and pass this knowledge to the current and future generations. Despite these little efforts, lack of sustainable digital technologies to preserve and ensure accessibility of this knowledge, endangers the knowledge of Kaja. Therefore, there is the urgent need for digital preservation of these practices to salvage the situation before it is too late. \n\nThe traditional circumcision is seen as the foundation for fostering lifetime unity and brotherhood amongst boys. This practice is associated with social cohesion of boys of the same age who become circumcised at the same time.\nThrough this rite, young boys are taught peacebuilding and how to live in harmony with other communities\nThe rites performed serves as a prayer for unhindered success for the boys throughout their lifetime.\n\n\nAlthough there are several changes witnessed over the years due to modernisation and the recent insurgency, the study found that the core philosophy has remained intact at least within the elders. This knowledge can however die with these elders if concrete actions are not taken to preserve them. It is imperative to digitally preserve these knowledges and performances to make them accessible to displaced Kanuri people and the future generations.","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","from document to data"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-18T13:30:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13906269","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13906269","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13906269","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MToYP8iGZoTWR3l_d6IHQm8iNRXr1ozm5lJNA9ercLM/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/3ec04ee9969c4ac48501aa9100cd6f752a2085cce7cc414588e4c6fc22f07e98"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

As such, we need to take steps along that journey, no matter how imperfect, to at least attempt to preserve those objects entrusted to us. For too long we had been frozen on our journey at Ohio State, when confronted with born digital collections at scale; stuck in the binary of how do we describe these collections at the item level to ingest them into our existing digital preservation repository, Digital Collections, or doing nothing at all. We had simply embraced the latter. \nHowever, in the summer of 2021 we began to scheme the development of a lightweight, cloud-based digital preservation platform that could complement our existing digital preservation repo. One that would be based upon the archival principle of more product, less processing (MPLP). As we began to engage stakeholders, as well as architect, build and test the repository, we actually realized that this new repo was much more in alignment with our collecting and accessioning practices. We were essentially building a digital version of archival and special collections stacks. A digital preservation platform that contains minimally described objects that are tied to their finding aids, where they are discoverable by our users; while being stored in a secure space where only the curators can “wander” just like our secured stacks. Therefore, we have created a “gray” or “dim” repository, which is neither “light” (allows patron access) nor “dark” (essentially no access). Launched in January 2024, the Gray Digital Preservation Repository, is now our default repo for born digital content.\nThis poster will document the journey we have embarked upon, along with the workflow and tools, open source and proprietary, that we have used to build and sustain this new environment. While acknowledging the privilege of our institution, we feel there are lessons learned from this journey that may benefit institutions of all sizes and resources.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","scaling up"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-18T11:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13513821","citation_pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tj4LyqvDKE_fO5_aPU-BuwK3JenwVDqg/view?usp=drive_link"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The lore behind our game, which combines a medieval setting with modern, digital technology, is essential to attracting players to the game and contextualizing the purpose and journey motif of the game. \n\nThe story of Dungeons & Documents is set in the Kingdom of Archeion, which is split into five parts: four provinces, and one central Citadel. The Kingdom has entered a new era of peace after a long and brutal war, the \"War for the Cloud\", which began after the discovery of a new magic, which allows any kind of document to be replicated and kept in a ‘cloud’. King Codex III, in an effort to bind the provinces together by shared knowledge and community, has ordered that a chosen archivist be sent from each province bearing their land’s most important and treasured documents. In order to reach the Citadel, the archivists must travel over dangerous terrain full of threats that can weaken and even destroy their precious digital collections. For them to succeed, they must draw upon their knowledge of digital preservation practices so they may triumph over danger and take their place in the Citadel’s Renaissance Library. \n\nAcross the course of the game, players have to keep preserving the three digital objects they have in their possession by doing backups (adding 'lives') and adding metadata (adding value). By linking backups to the common concept of 'lives' from video games and metadata to the concept of value, which is tallied up at the end of the game and which determines the winner, the game manages to incorporate digital preservation terms into game logic. Through the use of these simplified concepts and the journey motif, the game communicates the following basic digital preservation principles: the ongoing nature of digital preservation, the importance of backups, as well as the fact that the more metadata an object has, the more valuable it is.","full_text":null,"type":"game","categories":null,"keywords":["communications and advocacy for dp","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-18T13:35:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TECjLA7x-Wy1GeVBzuw5jjqsObbotGkgJbFvOfm-kpo/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

After the accident, the Memory and Archive Section of the museum (SEMEAR) took over the iconographic items of the extinct Photography Section, including a series of 219 cardboard with collages of printed photographs. After the archivist treatment, the cardboards were digitized, according to Brazilian norms for digital preservation. The following analyses revealed that part of these photographic cardboards represent printed samples of the lost glass plate negatives, constituting the last physical evidence of the lost collection. This highlights the importance of the preservation of this material and your scientific dissemination to promote the knowledge, the safeguard of the national memory and to offer full access to the general public. This collection illustrates scientific expeditions, former exhibitions, and didactic materials used by researchers at the National Museum, providing a valuable source of knowledge about scientific development in Brazil.

Emails documenting decisions on specific activities or actions. – Easily lost as emails accumulate over time and emails containing decisions are mingled with emails which do not.\n \nTo ensure that there is a more structured framework to document decisions, NAS is currently piloting a documentation framework for digital preservation. Decisions made during preservation activities are recorded using a template based on the Architectural Decision Record (ADR) methodology. Where a decision is important enough that a higher-level policy or workflow document must be updated, this update is also recorded using a template based on ADR.\n \nBy implementing such a framework, NAS hopes to,\n \nImplement preservation plans more consistently without duplication of work,\nImprove governance and accountability for decision making,\nEnsure institutional knowledge is retained, allowing new staff to learn and understand past decisions.\n \nAn important aspect of this pilot is to try and minimise the number of changes required to existing practices to not disrupt current operations. Existing documentation will be incorporated, while recording of operational decisions will carry on more intentionally and moved from email to ADR-based templates.\n \nThis lightning talk describes this pilot documentation framework for digital preservation and takeaways from the experience so far.","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["governance, resourcing, and management for dp","scaling up"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-18T11:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13379521","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13379521","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13379521","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FD-lIrViKGWNpBR8inlhbkoudzx4OqY7IM5C7anGIn0/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/3c201d717da7420295f0ae90d0b0b1e9787aeff96d2548fb8552074190b13848"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

This talk explores a collaborative initiative undertaken by a consortium of NSW Government cultural institutions to develop a system-agnostic Submission Information Package (SIP) specification as part of a broader digital preservation pilot project. The objective was to establish a unified framework that supports interoperability across diverse organisations while accommodating unique preservation requirements and metadata standards of each institution as part of a shared digital preservation solution.\n\nLeveraging standards such as the Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS), PREservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies (PREMIS), and the Bagit File Packaging Format, the project aimed to create a common SIP specification that could integrate seamlessly with any existing or future digital preservation system infrastructure. The development process involved comprehensive stakeholder analysis, requirement gathering, iterative design, and pilot testing with datasets from participating institutions. Several revisions were made to the original specification to better align with practical challenges and feedback from participating institutions. This iterative refinement process was crucial to ensuring that the specification could effectively handle the diverse nature of digital content and metadata practices across different institutions.\n\nThe resulting SIP specification not only streamlined the ingest process but also ensured a consistent approach to metadata and digital object management across institutions. This talk offers insight into collaborative processes and technical considerations crucial for developing shared digital infrastructure.","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","scaling up"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-18T11:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13667924","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13667924","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13667924","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b42Bd_pn9__lo1qwjKqh3fB46M9Dt_1hjO4ATMggwvg/edit#heading=h.3motvki8sysj","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/c4ff0ba130054fff8dfd6d0fb3f33463d66167c2df83459e89304b6b9778c302"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

But how can workflows within a consortium with several institutions be represented and handled? The poster describes how existing workflows from different institutions can be combined and linked. \nIn the LaVaH consortium twelve Hessian universities and unversities of applied sciences work together with the headquarters of the hebis library network for a common digital preservation network of digital data in Hesse. Based on a distributed infrastructure, the local data curators are responsible for curating and selecting objects for preservation and creating the submission information packages (SIP). The archiving process is carried out centrally by the hebis headquarters.\nThe institutions have different types of data that need to be archived. There are also different collections within an institution, which come from different sources and go through their own workflows in the run-up to long-term archiving. Different ingest formats are defined for the respective collections, i.e. the form in which the submission information packages (SIP) are packed and the format in which the metadata is delivered. Accordingly, the processes and tools that accompany the path from existing data and metadata to a SIP are different. Various tools are used at the institutions, e.g. for digitizing historical sources. It therefore makes sense to exchange about the partners' approach and to check if existing routines and tools can be reused by other institutions. \nTo achieve a structured overview of the various processes and workflows all partners are asked to describe the workflows in their companies, as well as to identify who is responsible and name the tools used. The results are presented in an internal workshop.\nThe poster describes the different workflows with possible overlaps and interfaces on the one hand and the process towards a common understanding and representation on the other.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["governance, resourcing, and management for dp","from document to data"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-19T11:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13646719","citation_pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/13yHIxJzEAvz2hC6fn_itnX8t3Uj9Xu4_/view?usp=drive_link"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

SAM-FS is soon reaching \"EOL\". The NLN has recently developed a front-end software solution called DPS (Digital Preservation Services). DPS uses HPSS from IBM as underlying bit-repository. DPS/HPSS is intended to replace SAM-FS as the preservation solution for digital objects. DPS requires that all objects must be delivered with associated checksums. \n\nIn the old SAM-FS bit-repository, many objects lack checksums, especially material from the first years of its use. All objects in SAM-FS are stored in 3 instances. If differences were to be uncovered between the 3 instances, there are no checksums to verify which instance is correct. The total amount of data to be migrated from SAM-FS to DPS is approximately 14 Petabytes. It is estimated that about 1/3 of these data lacks checksums. \n\n**Challenge**: How could we ensure that objects migrated from SAM-FS to DPS are the same as those originally archived in SAM-FS when original checksums do not exist? \n\n**How we solved it:** Based on access to multiple instances of the preserved objects, stored on different media in SAM-FS, we created a workflow that migrated objects from SAM-FS to DPS using checksums pre-generated from the tape instance to verify the disk instance. This ensured that the migrated data was considered \"authentic\" relative to the time it was submitted to the SAM-FS bit-repository. \n\n**Result**: So far, we have re-archived 3 Petabyte. Generating checksums has prevented data loss in the migration process in one specific case. We experienced that a number of files we read from the disk copy in SAM-FS had incorrect checksums. It turned out that one of the archive disk systems had a corrupt file system after an unexpected shutdown. The way we had created and stored checksums before starting the migration allowed us to quickly discover that there was something wrong with many files to be migrated. If we hadn't had these pre-generated checksums and just relied on reading the disk copy from SAM-FS, generating checksums, and then sending the object to DPS, data would have been lost.","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["information technology for dp","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-19T13:35:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13681583","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13681583","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13681583","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lDWYct0heJztUyK5nOaDaLFRBO-Yx4PXT5URfiK3xZo/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/fac102093df84a8c93031824fad34cd95d7f83fd04574b0884545e07bee9e47f"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Our current digital transfer process requires users to extract records from the cloud before transfer (through re-upload to the cloud). This is slow, inefficient, error-prone and, most importantly, can disrupt or lose metadata (particularly dates). It also introduces challenges in selecting export formats. A significant volume of records are affected – both current records and legacy data that has been migrated to the cloud. Scalability is essential.\n\nThis lighting talk will describe a feasibility study into enabling users to send records directly from depositors’ SharePoint services to the Archive, quickly, securely and without loss of metadata or file integrity. The study engaged with external partners including Microsoft.\n\nCriteria for maintaining integrity were identified:\n•\tTransfer user is clearly identified throughout the process\n•\tTransfer consignments are identified and tracked\n•\tUsers can select which records to transfer\n•\tThe Archive can securely access only selected records\n•\tComprehensive metadata is harvested without disruption\n•\tMetadata is in a form suitable for ingest into archival systems\n•\tFiles are harvested and uploaded to the Archive for ingest\n•\tHarvesting triggers AWS step-functions which automatically initiate archival processing\n•\tUser administration, registration and compliance policies are met\n•\tSecurity and accessibility standards are met\n\nThe study identified implementation options including full or minimal integration with a 3rd party app and bespoke development. The talk will outline the options and discuss some outstanding questions which we continue to explore:\n\n•\tResearch into usability and adoption rates\n•\tResearch into how depositors organise SharePoint metadata\n•\tUnderstanding how the Archive wishes to consume and process harvested records and metadata, including custom metadata and tags\n•\tScaling constraints on records size or volume\n•\tSustainability of the app approach, including ownership models, costs, maintenance, support, exit strategy","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["metadata standards and implementation","scaling up"],"license":"UK Open Government Licence v3","date":"2024-09-19T13:40:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13684688","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13684688","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13684688","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lDWYct0heJztUyK5nOaDaLFRBO-Yx4PXT5URfiK3xZo/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/fac102093df84a8c93031824fad34cd95d7f83fd04574b0884545e07bee9e47f"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}
{"title":"TDR: the hard drive forward","url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/ipres/ipres-2024/papers/tdr-the-hard-drive-forward/","creators":["Kirsten Arnold"],"abstract":"The National Archives (UK) has archived born-digital records for over 20 years. However, our records transfer process (using hard drives) has historically been slow and error-prone. Depositors struggle with technically demanding requirements for preparation and characterisation of digital records. We offer guidance and training but we need to do more.\n\nIn 2020 we embarked on the development of a cloud-based service for digital transfer. The new service, ‘Transfer Digital Records’ or TDR, helps UK Government departments upload, prepare and transfer custody of digital public records to TNA for permanent preservation and access. TDR addresses pain points for depositors, removing the need to install digital preservation tools client-side, eliminating metadata spreadsheets, and reducing back-and-forth of records. TDR delivers a more complete, better-structured and more timely record to the archive.\n\nTDR allows transferring departments to upload records via a browser, it performs automated checks including checksums (compared before and after upload), metadata extraction, file format identification and virus scanning. The interface lets users add custom metadata and describe sensitivities and access conditions.\n\nTDR is being built following Agile principles. Our Users are central to the design of the service. We conducted a thorough Discovery (proof-of-concept) followed by a fast Alpha (functional prototype), testing with users all the way. TDR is being built in the open - our code is available for re-use. We’re happy to discuss how others might integrate elements of TDR into their workflows.\n\nThe initial service was released in public Beta in April 2023 and has already made it easier and faster to transfer records. We are seeing daily small transfers of digital records to the archive, allowing us to move away from large batches towards a ‘little and often’ principle which brings records into the safety of the archive much earlier.\n\nWe are working to widen our scope to accept records directly from cloud ecosystems such as SharePoint or Google. We also wish to increase automated processing to help our users, for example, by detecting (near-)duplicates of records already in the archive or flagging potentially sensitive content. This poster showcases the TDR journey and explores future challenges.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["information technology for dp","start 2 preserve"],"license":"UK Open Government Licence v3","date":"2024-09-17T11:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13684925","citation_pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oxLNXb1llzEBkG_wDjpqWLrBPbwy7UPT/view?usp=drive_link"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

While libraries and archives have strategies for preserving print newspapers, hyper-local digital newspapers are less likely to be preserved. This is at a time of rapid loss of hyper-local print news and an increased dependence on digital-only news.\n\nA mechanism for preserving digital news is web archiving, but due to the rapid turnover of stories on news websites, it can be difficult to visit the site frequently enough to capture every article. Some newspapers provide RSS feeds, but not all, and it can be difficult to detect corrected articles in these feeds. Other newspapers implement a subscription model and cannot be harvested without a special arrangement. Some newspapers are aggregated into larger databases, but these often don’t include the smallest digital-only platforms and are for-profit subscription services that may not be preserved by a third party.\n\nPortico is a community-supported dark archive for scholarly material that forms agreements and works with publishers to preserve their content. Based on this research, Portico initiated a pilot to determine if digital news articles could be managed in a similar way to journal articles. Portico partnered with a single newspaper and worked with their content management system provider to retrieve an XML export of every article. The XML and supporting files (photos etc.) were successfully ingested into the archive and were similar to journal articles. To confirm if this was repeatable, Portico worked with another newspaper on the same platform and reused the workflow with few changes.\n\nPortico is repeating this experiment with two more newspapers on different platforms. If the content can be archived from each, Portico will seek to expand the work and develop a business model to support a broader effort in digital news preservation. An early step will be to reach out to the ~3000 newspapers on the platforms that have already been configured.\n\nFor the poster, the author will share details of the process used for this project and seek feedback from the community about the value of this approach for preserving digital news.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","scaling up"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-17T13:35:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13621505","citation_pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xu-LQuCz3VM38X_sEVfOhBzXE5qMFyRW/view?usp=drive_link","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bukG4bEvICUzC-Fp3KAcHmq2wRuqU8x67PRAuX-RwR4/"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Preservationists need comprehensive information about datasets' creation, relevance, and long-term value to support informed preservation decisions. Our proposed solution is to involve data curators in appraisal for preservation early in the dataset deposit processing order to capture the richest possible understanding of a dataset’s current and perceived long-term usefulness. By leveraging their unique position working with depositors, curators can collect essential information to inform preservation decisions and reduce duplication of effort in (re)appraisal over time. \n\nIn this poster presentation, we will share recent efforts to finalize and publish an appraisal checklist to be used by data curators at the point of ingest, in their interactions with depositors, and then later, by preservationists during a (re)appraisal process.

{"title":"XDCAM digital transfer project","url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/ipres/ipres-2024/papers/xdcam-digital-transfer-project/","creators":["Laura Ulens"],"abstract":"Meemoo, the Flemish Institute for Archives, is a non-profit organisation committed to supporting the digital archive operations of cultural, media and government organisations.  One of meemoo’s core objectives is digitising endangered audio-visual heritage. Since 2013, meemoo has been working together with 10 regional broadcasters to safeguard their archives. From 2013 to 2020, we mainly prioritised the digitisation of analog archives, focussing on video tapes such as Betacam SP. In these digitisation projects, meemoo stuck to a certain procedure where the regional broadcasters prepared the tapes by barcoding, cataloguing and packaging, while the digitisation itself was executed by an external service provider, and the digital files were archived into the meemoo archive. In 2021 we set up a unique project for the digital transfer of a specific digital carrier format used mainly by regional broadcasters in Flanders: the professional disc or XDCAM, where the regional broadcaster functioned as both content and service provider.\n\nXDCAM, a video carrier using optical disc, was in use by Flemish regional broadcasters from approx. 2007 until as recent as 2019. The aim of meemoo’s digital transfer project was to ensure the sustainable preservation of the material stored on these discs for two specific regional broadcasters.\n\nDue to these discs’ unique character  - the use of an optical disc instead of tape - a custom approach which differed from meemoo’s previous digitisation projects was required. For this project we relied on a combination of meemoo’s experience with common digitisation practices and the digital ingest flow, as well as on the technical equipment and knowhow of the regional broadcasters.\n\nThe project allowed for the digital transfer and ingest of over 55.000 clips from almost 6000 XDCAM discs for the two regional broadcasters. However, this was not without challenges. From the registration of the carriers, to the transfer process, to the submission and subsequent ingest into the meemoo archival system several hurdles had to be overcome. This gave us valuable insights for the future on how to better approach these types of projects where the carrier lies somewhere on the border between the analogue and the digital.","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-17T11:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13683066","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13683066","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13683066","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q7uNrEVGePdeRV2G9qDrO4AfNgIr2YY_xpKU99e61Yo/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/33b18535dd5843ffb8f79c836fadf7895bec43f73c7f4e4682ff38249050ad85"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

With the advent of technological advances, digital transformation, and the coronavirus pandemic, these changes have become essential throughout Brazilian public administration. This poster presents an overview of the current state of digital preservation of records related to the Brazilian justice system. The objectives of the research are to identify Brazilian public institutions that work with the digital preservation of records within the scope of the justice system, analyze the digital preservation actions established in normative acts and on the websites of the selected institutions, request access to information related to the organizational resources of the digital preservation of these institutions, and diagnose digital preservation actions in the Brazilian justice system based on the institutions researched and the organizational resources made available in the Digital Preservation Coalition's Rapid Assessment Model. Thus, the institutions were identified and selected within the scope of the empirical framework, followed by a survey and documentary analysis, and requests for access to information related to the organizational resources of these institutions. Finally, the current state of digital preservation actions in the Brazilian justice system was diagnosed based on this preliminary investigation. The research is characterized as exploratory and descriptive, with a qualitative approach, of a social and applied nature. As a result of this research, four institutions were selected, two Superior Courts and two Public Ministries, these representing a Union power and a state unit. Although organizational capabilities for digital preservation are in basic development, there is still much to be done. Therefore, the periodic application of digital preservation maturity assessment models in each institution of the Brazilian justice system is necessary for internal monitoring and progress.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["governance, resourcing, and management for dp","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Zero (CC0-1.0)","date":"2024-09-18T13:35:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13643315","citation_pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IAF55Biaq8LbkRtcSZb0BNkiEg4gVkyv/view?usp=drive_link","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O71NsTHl1erV9cOk6ryAt_fu89P9WTLDnwbbtluYc2E/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/e468e40244c34b82858b50fb7eb58232f195eb8a607a42afa3eb4938971cce8d"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The project design was based on OAIS and aims to provide an agnostic infrastructure (suitable for any type of digital object) for the long-term preservation of every digital object created by the UNIMI: data from research and - in the future - cultural assets, and administrative documents.\nArkive has a modular infrastructure:\n1.            The storage system is based on Swarm Datacore cloud technology (S3). Despite it is usually addressed to cloud storage we chose to maintain the infrastructure on servers owned by university network. This way, there are better guarantees regarding data control from both security and data protection perspectives.\n2.            The file system is virtualized through iRODS, making it possible to completely replace the storage (or its parts), both in terms of hardware and technologies, without impacting the archive's structure.\n3.            The data management \"engine\" is Archivematica, which allows for the analysis, normalization, packaging, and movement of data into the repository. aTOM is the application currently serving as the archive's catalog/OPAC for its public part.\n4.            User access is permitted in read/write mode only in the data transfer zone and can occur through various methods: client, web page, command line, etc. Some of these methods provide advanced functionalities for transferring large amounts of data.\nThis approach allows for the construction of solutions highly customized considering UNIMI structure and possible economic constraints and thus facilitating the long-term sustainability of this type of activity.\nAs the project developed, it became clear that Arkive is just one of several centralized facilities for research data management at UNIMI, alongside other platforms like Dataverse and Indaco (the UNIMI’s High-Performance Computing infrastructure). To overcome fragmentation, efforts are underway to integrate these services into a digital ecosystem for research data management.\nThe ultimate goal is to create a unified personal workspace environment that integrates all research-related services provided by the UNIMI.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","from document to data"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-18T13:30:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13684176","citation_pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PhVu-TpdUhMygcY820mrW3bEO9Txwhvw/view?usp=drive_link","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O71NsTHl1erV9cOk6ryAt_fu89P9WTLDnwbbtluYc2E/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/e468e40244c34b82858b50fb7eb58232f195eb8a607a42afa3eb4938971cce8d"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

In the process of transferring these to the digital preservation system, differences in file error messages and error handling emerged. This lightning talk intends to give a first view into the error types prominent for research data, comparing them to typical errors for text publications. It will focus specifically on those types of format validation and identification error messages that often indicate severe file errors. It will also introduce a possible approach to researching these error messages and their causes, as well as an example of resolving errors post-publication. Furthermore, it will raise various questions – such as ways to approach preservation actions that result in slight file changes and if these actions may already have an effect on research data integrity and technical compatibility with research software. It will also touch upon the question of handling relevant context material like standards which are not published alongside research data but may be necessary for its reusability in the long-term. Finally, it will give an overview of changes to our repository publication policy that have been introduced as a consequence of discussing these topics.","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","from document to data"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-17T15:35:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13683418","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13683418","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13683418","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RnqtK66DuBgEZBSuTMC7aU8i32AMZQUp5X-Qi1AQdNg/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/e14395c2e38544b884534e3ad374a2f5eb92a4bb791941e1ba0222a6c969343c"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

These guidelines help to expose relevant information as metadata at the organisational and object level to facilitate discovery, provide context, and support interoperability. The guidelines will also recommend accompanying evidence to create a sense of trust in the services themselves and service providers with focus put on exposing information about characteristics (e.g. contact information), information that can help to inform a sense or status of trustworthiness (e.g. preservation policy), and information relating to FAIRness of the digital objects held. The guidelines, and an implementation prototype, will establish relevance of the resources for stakeholders and it is essential that they are informed by community-input. \n\nThis poster will give insights on the modelling of the complex relations, the guidelines, and prototype, in order to encourage discussions and collect feedback from communities, including digital repositories, service providers, and users, so that we can ensure that the guidelines meet the needs of all stakeholders. \n\nWhilst certification for research data repositories exists (e.g. CoreTrustSeal) not all digital object services have an external authority assessing and validating the service provided. Therefore, this model will also support the transparent disclosure of self-declared assertions about functions and activities. This structured and interoperable format of information expression supports harvesting and validation by third parties, which reduces administrative overhead, improves interoperability, and benefits the wider research landscape. \n\nFAIR assessment of digital objects can be undertaken by anyone, however, a clear understanding of the results of an assessment requires further evidence regarding the assessment process. This is particularly important when assessment metrics are selected or adapted for a disciplinary context. The guidelines will therefore include the exposure of assessment characteristics, such as a FAIR assessment authority, the tool, its creators, and the evidence they hold.\n\nA prototype implementing the guidelines will serve as a proof of concept, illustrating the core functionality and purpose of the guidelines, showcasing mapping, reuse, and validating the evidence.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["legal and social responsibilities for dp","scaling up"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-18T15:30:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13495834","citation_pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S6gkqrbys0IayEFtZIYar5RGJAfW2Ixy/view?usp=drive_link"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

When this is applied to a digital archive, it can be more difficult to ensure that users know what they are accessing prior to viewing it due to the number of ways that digital data can be accessed. Add in the further complication of human remains from a British early medieval cemetery and things get a bit more complicated. The Archaeology Data Service, as a part of the High Speed 2 (HS2) infrastructure project, was tasked with archiving and disseminating data pertaining to the human remains from several cemeteries that were excavated over the course of the project. This talk will discuss the steps that the ADS took to add content advisories and context to digital archives that contained digital objects relating to different individuals.\n\nSo how was this done? Each digital archive and digital object that contains data about human remains receives a tag stating what sensitive information it contains. This tag then triggers notifications on the archive metadata page, the object metadata page, and blurs images/3D models where applicable. While this approach works to provide practical information for users, we felt that some digital objects should also be disseminated with additional contextual information. Within the medieval cemeteries excavated as part of HS2, most individuals were not easily identifiable, but we could give as much context as possible to each individual by linking each individual’s photogrammetry model with associated contextual information and excavation photos. This information was provided on an individual level with a specific web page that displayed an interactive 3D model and the associated contextual information. For larger cemeteries, the individuals were also presented spatially by showing their burial locations on a web map with a sidebar that provides the additional contextual information and links to the individual’s information page. The tagging and techniques that were used can be applied more broadly and include instances where harmful language is used for example and we hope to apply what we learned from HS2 to the rest of our archival holdings.","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["legal and social responsibilities for dp","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-18T11:05:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13744594","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13744594","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13744594","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b42Bd_pn9__lo1qwjKqh3fB46M9Dt_1hjO4ATMggwvg/edit#heading=h.3motvki8sysj","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/c4ff0ba130054fff8dfd6d0fb3f33463d66167c2df83459e89304b6b9778c302"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

But not all organisations are comfortable with fully outsourcing the responsibility for holding digital records, and may also worry about topics such as exit planning when moving to a new supplier or business continuity and disaster recovery in case of short or long-term issues with the cloud platform or provider.  Generally, some archives will be more comfortable if they also hold their own copy of their digital records in a form that can be read without need for proprietary systems or products. \n\nThe National Archives (UK) are making use of a cloud-based managed service for the actively managed and immediately accessible copy of their records but have also built a Custodial Copy system which automatically and immediately takes a copy of all records as they appear in the cloud-based system, and sends a copy to decoupled off-cloud storage.  These digital records won’t just be an IT backup of the cloud platform but will be stored in an product-agnostic standardised form, using the Oxford Common File Layout, and with each file accompanied by an up-to-date copy of all the metadata describing the record.

(Are all nodes operational and communicating correctly with each other?)\n- Have any copies ever needed repair ?\nMoreover, archivists also need to keep a complete history of their preservation network, ensuring that every action can be traced and used for auditing purposes.\nIn this lightning talk, I will explain how we implemented our dashboard solution to ensure enduring observability in a distributed preservation network, highlighting its key features.\nWhile the solution is applicable to any digital preservation network, I will illustrate it on the specific use case of SAFE PLN, a LOCKSS-based preservation network operated by seven university libraries, which celebrates its 10th anniversary this year. \nIn SAFE PLN, content is automatically collected from the institutional repositories of the 7 participating universities and distributed to preservation nodes across Europe and Canada.\nCopies are then regularly verified and automatically repaired using the LOCKSS technology developed at Stanford University. This open-source software was specifically designed to secure many distributed copies of digital archives and guarantee their integrity over the very long term. \nBy design, the peer-to-peer architecture of a LOCKSS network makes it truly decentralized and highly resistant to internal and external attacks. \nBut for the same reason, it's also difficult to monitor the status of the preservation network.\nOur open source dashboard solution based on Grafana provides each network member with global and detailed views of the network status, enabling each participant to track the status of their archived copies in real time. Problems in the network are also detected and reported instantly, enabling us to react quickly.\nBy ensuring observability and transparency, our dashboard contributes to making preservation networks more efficient, and brings greater peace of mind to all those concerned with protecting digital assets. \nOur solution has already been adopted by the Alabama Digital Preservation Network and is currently being deployed at the Michigan Digital Preservation Network.","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-17T11:05:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13653729","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13653729","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13653729","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18q7nGVrhTj5qLOs3b-qg74krPB0yPTA0GoltsBuA2w0/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/bd35e0d952454965a64a917ee3741564b70655a27ed640c5aad0d31be3cee8ec"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

UKERC carries out inter-disciplinary research into sustainable energy futures. The EDC curates UK energy research data, provides a discovery portal and expert advice on data management planning to UKERC researchers.  \nIn 2020, the authors joined the EDC and made explicit the implicit policy in place. They created formal collection management, collection cataloguing and preservation policies.  As part of the process, they undertook a Digital Preservation Coalition’s Rapid Assessment Model (RAM) review and created a development plan.  These activities were focused on the preservation aspects of the service and applied mainly to internal processes. \nIn January 2024, the EDC was accepted onto the FAIR-IMPACT repository support programme which aims to help repositories support the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable principles.  As part of the EDC’s FAIR-IMPACT action plan policies and practices are being reviewed with a FAIR perspective. \nThis poster will discuss these two approaches, their synergies and differences in supporting the creation of polices & procedures with FAIR principles or preservation in mind and how these two approaches have led to a better service. Current observations are below. \n(1) There is a different level of granularity and scale between preservation and FAIR: the FAIR principles start at the dataset level; most preservation repositories will deal with collections of objects. \n(2) Both approaches stress the importance of understanding the licenses connected to the content and that the descriptive metadata ensures that objects can be retrieved and understood, there is more emphasis in the FAIR resources on common domain ontologies/vocabularies whereas preservation resources discuss the importance of the knowledge level of the designated community.  \n(3) Trust in the repository and resource are important, FAIR principles have more emphasis on machine retrieval and hence how can the repository demonstrate trust through its API. \nFor the EDC, being able to preserve the collection for the long-term so that it is usable in the future and ensuring that the datasets within the collection are FAIR are equal priorities and using these approaches to focus on different aspects has improved the service.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["standards and models","from document to data"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-18T15:30:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13362273","citation_pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QxQjeua7QvRXsCUDmZCJOr5aKCHC_3wH/view?usp=drive_link"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

We will highlight those access related tasks which tend to be the most resource intensive and which can be considered bottlenecks in the process of scaling up, and we will share lessons learned, both good and bad.\nWe represent NEA (Netværket Elektronisk Arkivering – Network for Electronic Archiving), which is a network consisting of 31 Danish municipal archives, in which resources are pooled to build an organization capable of handling the challenges of digital archiving. Throughout the past 15 years or so, NEA has assisted our member archives in preserving more than 2000 databases, of which more than 1000 have been made available for use, using our in-house developed tool, called MiNEA.\nDanish municipal archives are tasked with preserving municipal public records, which in Denmark for the past 15-20 years have been almost exclusively digital. The main reason for preserving all these records is to preserve historical documentation about the Danish public administration for future generations, but also to serve the public as well as the municipal administrations that created the records in the first place. As even the oldest born-digital records are still very young, historical interest is low, and so the vast majority of inquires come from the public and from the municipal authorities who originally created the data. These inquiries usually match the types of inquiries made of the original IT systems, in which the records were created. For instance, finding all case records related to a specific personal ID number, all records related to a specific plot of land, etc.\nWe expect to showcase our tool alongside the poster, showing of the main features and allowing visitors to try it out for themselves.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["managing access","scaling up"],"license":"Creative Commons Zero (CC0-1.0)","date":"2024-09-17T11:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13649234","citation_pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HeDaF6ZZh4MZnslpkLrOFXwlQJZZg1LL/view?usp=drive_link"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Based on the confidentiality and sensitivity of the data suitable measures are taken to ensure information security. By doing so, valuable research data will not only be properly archived, but it will also unlock the potential for data sharing and effectively lead to a more efficient use of resources.

We examined how webpage lifespans have evolved using a sample of 27.3 million URLs archived from 1996 to 2021 by the Internet Archive (IA).\n\nWe found that only 35% of URLs remained active in 2023, indicating significant web inactivity over time. Our preliminary analysis suggests that these numbers are not inflated with soft 404s and other phenomena. We encountered DNS failures for 30% of 7 million unique domains. Surprisingly, almost half of the URLs initially archived in 1996–2000 were still active in 2023, suggesting the longevity of some early URLs. Sites like nasa.gov continue to exist. Conversely, some URLs had lifespans that defied measurement. Nearly 30% had short lifespans, with only one archived page or no \"200 OK\" mementos, indicating brief existence or limited archival interest.\n\nThe average lifespan of a web page in our dataset is 1.6 years. However, this average conceals the bimodal nature of root URLs, where 10% persist for less than a year, and nearly 20% thrive for over 20 years, resulting in an average lifespan of 3.9 years. Deep links have an average lifespan of 1.3 years.\n\nWe examined web page half-life, the time it takes for half of the pages to disappear. Root URLs had a half-life of nine years compared to one year for deep links. URLs from different decades exhibited varying lifespans: 1990s URLs had a half-life of 15-20 years, early 2000s URLs had 6-7 years, and URLs from 2003 to 2021 had 6 months to 3 years.\n\nUsing the IA as a source for sample URLs provides the only realistic, public option to study the evolution of the web at this scale and duration. However, there are well-known classes of pages that are not present in the Wayback Machine and our findings apply only to publicly archivable pages. They provide a nuanced understanding of web page longevity, emphasizing that while some URLs survive a long time, most have an ephemeral lifespan.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","from document to data"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-17T13:30:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13687116","citation_pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vvHT20i3jfp6ragkNnxe8D-HO0CswDUT/view?usp=drive_link"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

There are many platforms with different functions and characteristics, and they have different impacts on the production and preservation ecosystem of an artwork. Examples include social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter/X which are both a subject and medium of art, platforms such as Steam, the App Store or Github which are at the core of software distribution, and Discord, Slack or Stack Overflow where discussions about games and software-based art happen. Even though these platforms are very different, they raise some common concerns for preservation, namely around the dependency on an online resource where users have little to no control on the resource's evolution and longevity.\nThis is true in both the video game and the software-based art preservation contexts. Using the examples of the game TerraTech by Payload Studios, available on Steam, and the artwork Go Rando, by artist Ben Grosser,available on Chrome store, this presentation uses these two platforms to illustrate how platformisation, and the changes it drives in the ecosystems of artworks and videogames affects preservation, both positively and negatively.

The project focuses on three key data governance tasks: dataset discovery, interoperable tooling, and automated form generation. Flanders, a front-runner in adopting SHACL, provides a unique testing ground for these innovations.\n\nThe European Data Governance Act (DGA) seeks to promote fair and equitable data usage, enhance trust in data sharing, and establish a framework for data governance within the EU. Flanders, with its OSLO programme defining over 134 ratified semantic standards, is well-positioned to address data governance challenges through Linked Data technologies.\n\n##Project Goals:\n1. Data Discovery: Develop an algorithm for efficient dataset discovery using SHACL shapes, reducing discovery time from days to seconds. This will be piloted in at least two data portals, targeting a discovery rate of 20 datasets per second.\n2. Interoperable Tooling: Create an automation strategy for connecting different data processors across project partners Sirus, Inuits, and Redpencil. This involves developing a shared specification for interoperable workflows, allowing seamless data integration and processing.\n3. Automated Form Generation: Generate web forms for data collection automatically using SHACL shapes. This aims to cover 80% of existing data types, significantly reducing the manual effort required for form creation.\n\nThe project will culminate in a proof-of-concept map displaying traffic measurements across Flanders, showcasing the automated selection and integration of datasets based on SHACL shapes. This demonstrator will highlight the efficiency and scalability of the developed solutions. During this talk, we will go over the project goals in detail and explain the methodologies and strategies we are employing to achieve these research objectives. We will also discuss the specific technical challenges we face and how we will overcome them, providing a comprehensive overview of our approach and findings.","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["information technology for dp","from document to data"],"license":"Creative Commons Zero (CC0-1.0)","date":"2024-09-19T11:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13745085","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13745085","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13745085","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hf-VavCLYwGskk3JdDbnPOALZtP2Yd4w2pe_5Evkxg8/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/95ca2a083ac641f99b58185549d7c5407e49ac128c9e45efb96d32698a8f023a"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Archives, tasked with preserving the files of public authorities, are therefore confronted with the need to preserve also the emails linked to the public tasks of these authorities. The technical challenges surrounding email archiving have been long and extensively deliberated. Since 2013, Capstone archiving has emerged as a means to efficiently retain the vast amounts of emails sent and received by 'key figures' of public institutions and address deficiencies in manual archiving practices. While this approach holds significant promise and is thus being adopted or seriously considered by several archives, among which the Belgian State Archives, the legal intricacies associated with this approach remain inadequately elucidated. Specifically, a deeper examination of the legal ramifications stemming from the adoption of this US-origin methodology within the European context seems necessary.\n\nIn our poster, we will assess if and how Capstone can be a viable solution for European archives, compliant with legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

The University first embarked on web archiving through collecting community responses to the Covid-19 pandemic. This initiative provided a valuable opportunity to explore closer working with the UK Web Archive (UKWA) and to demonstrate the value of web archiving to the digital preservation of the institutional record. Further collaboration with the UKWA as part of an externally-funded project, Archive of Tomorrow, supported recruitment of a dedicated Web Archivist. This increased visibility and capacity allowed the University Archives to collaborate more meaningfully with the Website and Communications team who support web services for the institution’s many diverse communities. This poster will describe this collaboration and the shared roles and responsibilities for ensuring a sustainable and effective web service for users, from creation to long-term preservation. \n\nThe institutional web estate (both at the main URL and thousands of off-domain URLs) encompasses a vast array of valuable resources – from press releases to research project websites. In the absence of established pathways to the Archives for digital records, web archiving provides a strategy to capture some record of almost every activity and function of the institution, all in the context of their presence on the Web. This Web Lifecycle programme partners closely the UKWA, using their infrastructure and guidance as a core strategy to support the preservation of most content in scope. This partnership allows the Archive to focus on quality assurance, troubleshooting, and metadata creation, improving the existing records in the UKWA and also supporting institutional requirements without maintaining a local system or contracting a third-party vendor.  \n\nThis poster will discuss the benefits of this collaborative approach to web archiving to meet institutional digital preservation requirements. It will also address some of the limitations and challenges, such as licencing and aligning information policies across a complex, devolved web estate. Ultimately, this poster will demonstrate how collaboration – internal and external – has catalysed progress in preserving one of the most diverse and inclusive records of activity at a large University – its web estate.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","from document to data"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-17T13:30:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13682709","citation_pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/102Vgj5mxklCrv2_vVeh8aMQnMgObySqw/view?usp=drive_link"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The GHOST (Games of Horror in Open Science Training) Collective uses gamification to lower this barrier and spark interest in these topics with researchers and other practitioners. Because many Open Science concepts are concerned with digital preservation, the following GHOST games are very applicable and inspirational to the iPRES audience. \n\n[Open Science Against Humanity][1] is based on the Cards Against Humanity gameplay concept. Players hold several cards in their hands that can be matched to the prompts on the table. The funniest or most on-fleek response to each prompt ‘wins’; the winning player gets to keep the prompt. Whoever has won the most rounds at the end, wins the game. The prompts and responses are all related to several Open Science aspects, including the preservation of data and software and the significant effort associated with it - something that all digital preservationalists will recognise. Players are encouraged to make humorous moves but also look up and discuss the meaning of cards or terms they do not know and thus learn about various aspects of Open Science\n\n[Open <3 Science][2] is more content-focused. Players still hold several cards in their hands and get prompts on the table, but they are encouraged to find the best match based on factual and/or practical content. The prompts are about Open Science principles, while the response cards contain Open Science concepts, including a brief explanation and a QR code that leads to bibliographic source material where players can find more in-depth explanations about the concept. Players are encouraged to discuss which response is the best match to the prompt, based on what they learned about the concepts at hand. Also here, there are many concepts that digital preservationalists will know, from licences and digital sovereignty to labour-intensiveness and community.\n\nIn the session, players are invited to try both games in several groups. Each game takes approximately 20 minutes to play, depending on the discussions. Players can walk in and out freely.\n\n\n  [1]: https://github.com/ghostCollective/OpenScienceAgainstHumanity\n  [2]: https://nlesc.github.io/open-loves-science/","full_text":null,"type":"game","categories":null,"keywords":["communications and advocacy for dp","from document to data"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-18T12:05:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EpqhS1yogf1EkXxEsvlrgdWsdiCqR3NlRDoxBH8bUng/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Whilst these low levels of usage cannot be attributed to a single reason, inconsistent approaches to sharing, publishing, and describing papers over the past twenty years have not helped. This poster goes some way to explore a solution for more consistent description of papers, facilitating their findability and thus their potential for re-usability, by proposing a controlled vocabulary for iPRES submissions. \n\nA controlled vocabulary for iPRES papers was used in the early days of iPRES, namely the ACM set of classification codes. This however had limited specificity relevant to most iPRES submissions and was later abandoned. The current 'anything goes' approach enables greater specificity but results in more variation across the corpus as a whole: the problem has escalated from insufficient choice to too much choice. Search the iPRES keywords index produced for the DPC Registries of Good Practice, for example, and it suggests over a thousand different entries. The phrase 'needle in a haystack' comes to mind, especially problematic for not only early careerists and researchers but also practitioners with limited amounts of time but urgent business problems to address.\n\nThis poster proposes a controlled set of keywords as a first step towards improving consistent classification, findability and subsequently re-usability of our field's knowledge. The core structure is provided by the high level entities from the CHARM domain model on digital preservation risk. These identify at a consistently granular level the main aspects of the digital preservation domain (e.g. legal; policy; strategy; system software; network; metadata; content) and target values (e.g. authenticity; integrity; retrievability). These are supplemented by a cross referencing and subsequent merging of the top 30 (or so) keywords identified by the Good Practice project, and finally a gap analysis by the authors to identify and propose additional terms for areas that are possibly under-represented. Pending discussion with the community during iPRES and subsequent refinement of terms, the results (along with a user guide to facilitate consistent implementation) will be suggested to the iPRES steering group as a proposal for future events.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["managing access","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-17T11:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13713511","citation_pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ze5ckMVA55q1K0WWe7U_gHXPaGItX62o/view?usp=drive_link"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Digital Preservation with a French Touch","url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/ipres/ipres-2024/papers/francophonie-digital-preservation-with-a-french-touch/","creators":["YANNICK GRANDCOLAS"],"abstract":"The digital preservation field predominantly relies on English-language resources and documentation, presenting significant challenges for the Francophone community. Factors like staff training and the utilization of accented characters in alphabets exacerbate these difficulties, warranting targeted solutions to enhance Francophone contributions to the global digital preservation discourse.\n\nIn the rapidly evolving digital landscape, English has emerged as the lingua franca, shaping the discourse and dissemination of knowledge. Consequently, most technical discussions, guides, and scholarly articles pertinent to digital preservation are predominantly available in English. This linguistic hegemony poses barriers for Francophones seeking active engagement in digital preservation efforts. Language barriers not only impede comprehension and participation but also limit access to cutting-edge knowledge and practices within the field.\n\nAddressing these challenges is imperative to ensure equitable representation and active involvement of the Francophone community in digital preservation endeavors. Efforts must be directed towards enhancing staff training by providing resources and professional development programs in the native language of Francophones. Additionally, unique challenges associated with utilizing alphabets containing accented characters must be acknowledged and resolved to facilitate effective data management and preservation in Francophone contexts.\n\nThe \"birds of a feather\" session presents a singular opportunity to convene the Francophone digital preservation community for face-to-face discussions. This gathering will enable participants to share experiences, address challenges, and exchange best practices in an environment conducive to collaboration and idea-sharing. By bringing together Francophone experts and practitioners in digital preservation, this session aims to strengthen community bonds and identify innovative solutions to overcome linguistic and technical barriers. Through collaborative efforts, we can ensure that the Francophone voice is fully heard and its contributions enrich the global digital preservation landscape during iPRES 2024.","full_text":null,"type":"birds of a feather","categories":null,"keywords":["communications and advocacy for dp","from document to data"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-17T14:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/13TMF9JJFlRrsVmWaejYk5cWKOrdsEg9Ti9PwZTwMXzA/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Born-digital archives, however, provide strong arguments for both parties to engage actively and even require creators to be more involved. The case for partnerships between archivists, researchers and literary authors in dealing with born-digital archives has been made many times, but only continues to grow in importance as more born-digital archives are making their way into literary archival institutions (Pulkkinen 2023; Jaillant 2022; Ries & Palkó 2019; Gooding, Smith & Mann, 2019). \nThe scale and complexity of born-digital archives enforces strong partnerships between creators, archives and research in order to guarantee a real future for born-digital (literary) heritage. Genuine collaboration between scholars and archivists creates many pathways for developing and enhancing archival workflows for acquiring, describing and unlocking born-digital archives for research. Researchers get better acquainted with limitations and possibilities of born-digital archives, enabling them to articulate solid research questions. Collaboration with creators is no less important, as they play a crucial role in the preservation of their digital documents (Micunovic, Marčetić, and Krtalić 2016).\nIn this Lightning Talk we share our experience of the collaboration between the Letterenhuis (Isabelle Van Ongeval) and the University of Antwerp (Lamyk Bekius) in the scope of born-digital archives. Our regular meetings to discuss approaches and research interests regarding born-digital archives have already led to concrete results. These include: joining forces in persuading Flemish authors to donate their old computers to the Letterenhuis and make them available for research projects; working together on a project with the Flemish poet Maud Vanhauwaert to log the writing process of a poem for the Letterenhuis’ new collection exhibition; an exploration of the filecontents on the floppy disks of the Flemish poet and essayist Herman de Coninck to make them more findable and more accessible for research; and partnering up for the (proposed) CLARIAH-VL+ International Research Infrastructure, in which we plan to develop a model for the description of born-digital and hybrid (literary) archives.","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["managing access","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-17T11:10:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13745238","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13745238","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13759303","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q7uNrEVGePdeRV2G9qDrO4AfNgIr2YY_xpKU99e61Yo/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

{"title":"A three-tier digital preservation strategy","url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/ipres/ipres-2024/papers/a-three-tier-digital-preservation-strategy/","creators":["Snowden Becker","Alicia Wise","Anthony Leroy"],"abstract":"As university libraries, one of our key missions is to preserve scholarly digital content for future generations.\nThis implies safeguarding our own digital collections, of which we are the sole custodian, as these often include unique materials created by our scientific community. Examples include Ph.D. theses, offprints, and research data.\nWe must also ensure enduring access to subscribed scholarly content even if the subscription is canceled or if publishers discontinue publications. \nTo meet these challenges, we encourage libraries to adopt a global strategy based on three solutions leveraging the LOCKSS open-source technology. \nOur poster depicts the implementation of this 3-pillar strategy at Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB) :\n\n**1. Community network**\nWhile a university library alone is unlikely to have the required human and technological resources to build an efficient distributed preservation solution, LOCKSS technology makes it easy for libraries to build their own community network to safeguard their collections of interest. \nFollowing this approach, ULB - together with 6 university partners worldwide - has funded the SAFEPLN network in 2014. \nContent is collected from our institutional repositories and replicated in seven preservation nodes, distributed across servers hosted in Europe and Canada.\nCurrently, a dozen similar networks have been created worldwide, with various objectives, scopes and organizational models.\n\n**2. Global LOCKSS Network**\nAs a solution for post-cancellation access to our electronic resources, ULB joined the Global LOCKSS Network in 2012.\nIf we terminate a subscription to one of our resources or the resource becomes temporarily unavailable from the publisher, a copy remains available in our local server and we can restore access to our users.\n\n**3. CLOCKSS**\nUnfortunately, not all our key electronic resources are available on the Global LOCKSS network. Therefore, ULB also chose to support the CLOCKSS service from 2024. \nCLOCKSS is a dark archive encompassing over 54 million journal articles, and 475.000 e-books from the world's leading publishers, ensuring open access if content disappears from the web.\n\nThe three-pillar approach outlined here empowers libraries to take charge of their digital preservation. Instead of relying on third-party solutions, we become active players in preservation, embracing our essential mission.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-19T09:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13652938","citation_pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ba6l0lV5PQ3wo5k6k5dWb6Pq1Xei0nTa/view?usp=drive_link"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Keeping track of documentation and to-dos is challenging in the early stages of program development. \n\nWorkflows, traditionally seen as documentation tools, offer a unique solution for tracking the development of digital preservation programs. Instead of viewing workflows as static documents, they can be transformed into dynamic roadmaps that guide practitioners through the program’s inception and evolution.  By crafting bespoke, high-level workflows tailored to individual institutional contexts, practitioners can effectively use them as planning tools. These workflows serve not only as project management tools to track progress but also help effectively communicate with program stakeholders. \n\nWorkflows were used in planning Acadia University’s digital preservation program. The development of an ingest workflow identified key components of digital preservation, including ensuring authenticity, fixity, processing, and transfer into long-term storage. Identifying these components ensured tools were procured that adequately addressed ingest requirements. Sharing practical lessons learned through utilizing workflows in the planning stages of creating a new digital preservation program allows for other institutions to follow a similar process. Workflows, policy, and implementation are interrelated, and focusing on workflows highlighted priorities for Acadia’s policy development.

Metadata plays a key role across all of our processes, from preservation to enabling dissemination through search. Hence, improving the accessibility and management of metadata are crucial activities of our operations, in particular with the ever-growing scale in volume and heterogeneity. To this end, meemoo is currently evolving towards a Knowledge Graph-based infrastructure. In this poster, we present our new set of data models that support this endeavor.\n\nThe meemoo data models have a layered design, with a core model that is applicable across media objects from various types accompanied by a number of domain-specific models that cover different use cases. They were developed using an iterative methodology to design, implement, and evaluate data models with internal and external stakeholders. The core Objects model builds upon PREMIS (OWL) and is used to  model the main structure of the media objects, which identifies the preserved intellectual entity, its representations, its files, and the way they relate. The domain models complement the core model and include, among others, models to describe the media contents (Descriptive model), information about the partners that own the material (Organizations model), and digitization or provenance metadata (Events model). \n\nThe different data models are implemented using a combination of RDFS and SHACL to ensure a smooth integration in the Knowledge Graph infrastructure. The use of RDF-based standards adds greater flexibility and enhances the models’ semantic clarity. Each resource and relationship can be explicitly modeled, identified, defined and labeled, while promoting reuse through Linked Open Data. In addition, it also provides machine-readability to support automation, which enables us to automatically generate documentation or a GraphQL schema from the SHACL source files. \n\nOur poster illustrates the data models, the design methodology and how the data models are used across meemoo in various applications and with different purposes. Both documentation and sources are available on [our developer documentation website][1].\n\n\n  [1]: https://developer.meemoo.be/docs/metadata/knowledge-graph/","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["metadata standards and implementation","from document to data"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-19T13:30:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13683132","citation_pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/101n_kxalTFkpCL4TXmmc_iEHwf_jx5--/view?usp=drive_link"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

However, new challenges appear on the horizon, often originating from areas beyond our profession. We may no longer be able to conquer these within the existing preservation community, like we are used to do. But perhaps we can find inspiration for new initiatives by looking back at how it all started.\nThree decades ago, in 1998, a group of 60 people gathered in Hotel dos Templarios in Tomar, Portugal. They arrived from around 20 countries to participate in the first international workshop on digital preservation in Europe. The air was filled with eagerness and enthusiasm. Everyone felt part of a new and adventurous journey: how to preserve electronic (aka digital) heritage.\nThis DELOS 6th workshop on Preservation was organized by two (!) projects funded by the European Commission: DELOS, consisting of computer scientists and NEDLIB, a project of national libraries. Two different worlds coming together in one place.\nThe 15 presenters at the workshop spoke on a range of topics, seemingly inspired by the 1996 report of Garrett and Waters “Preserving digital information”. On this poster I’ll map these topics to the status quo to show the tremendous progress the digital preservation community has made. Over time, the heritage organisations involved were able to translate the problems into workable solutions. Individual initiatives were connected in collaborative projects, initiated and funded by heritage organisations themselves with the support of the European Commission, the National Science Foundation and various governments. The profession of digital preservation shaped itself.\nThe Tomar workshop started with a film “Into the Future. On the preservation of knowledge”. An initiative of CLIR, still available on Vimeo. The film aimed to raise awareness, amongst the general public and policy makers, of the risk of losing digital information. In just 50 minutes, broadcast via television, it conveyed the necessity of digital preservation.  \nHow might we grab the attention of today's decision makers in a similarly creative way?","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["communications and advocacy for dp","scaling up"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-19T11:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13642755","citation_pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jCHW6pPa6IXNLa9aGduGTu-FzsTDoJAu/view?usp=drive_link"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

We will be demo-ing a software and Web archive workflow using an interconnected ecosystem of open source tools: [OCCAM][1] with plugins for [Memento Tracer][2] and [Memento Damage][3]. We use these together to create a repeatable, human- and computer-readable workflow to preserve scholarly code on the Web with its discussion threads, documentation, and other contextual scholarly ephemera that you can’t get with a `git clone`. \n\nOCCAM is an open source software preservation and workflow execution system that allows users to visually create executable workflows. OCCAM instances can federate with each other, allowing for these to be shared. Memento Tracer is a browser extension that allows users to click on desired elements from  an exemplar webpage to create JSON ‘traces,’ which are then used to crawl and create Web archives. These traces can be used on websites that look similar to each other (e.g. code repositories on GitHub or GitLab) and can themselves be version controlled. Memento Damage is an open source tool that calculates how well a web page is archived by identifying the missing resources (images, multimedia, CSS, and JavaScript) and then measuring the importance of those missing resources.\n\nWe use OCCAM as the “driver,” where we visually build (via drag-and-drop) the processes together and run it together. So we use Git clone to grab the source code, as well as run a Memento trace to grab other elements of a repository page that we want to keep for history and debugging purposes -- issue threads, pull requests, project boards, online documentation, etc. We end up with a local copy of a Git repository (to preserve the commit history) and a WARC containing the Web-based contextual information. We then use Memento Damage to do some initial quality assurance and checking. We can then export this together with some metadata and it’s ready for a repository!

These restrictions even extend to archiving government information shared through official social media accounts. In this session, we will facilitate discussions on specific barriers including but not limited to the legal, ethical, policy-related, practical, technological and organisational contexts of social media archiving in research and cultural heritage institutions. We will also share experiences navigating these challenges, as well as brainstorm advocacy strategies to tackle these barriers and change the existing framework. \n\nWe aim to engage a diverse group of representative stakeholders and experts, including archivists and digital preservation professionals from academic institutions, government bodies, and (private) cultural heritage organisations, as well as researchers, legal experts, and technologists.

The technical architecture is based on a hyper secured ring network topology integrating all users and data centres. The two data centres are completely redundant and are equipped with an identical hardware infrastructure where cold storage is used as the main preservation methodology. Ingest, load balancing, authentication of users, integrity checks, file formats check, REST Api services, monitoring and retrieve workflows have been integrated in one middleware system. Belspo issued a tender procedure for the operationalisation of the hardware, software and service desk which was granted to a private partner.\nThe contract ended in 2022 and Belspo decided not to prolong the contract but to develop a renewed hard- and software architecture in-house with the Belgian association Smals, within the same yearly budget. Belspo launched a co-creation activity with Smals to setup a migration path and planning for the 4 Petabyte of unique volume of digital cultural heritage, research data and metadata, duplicated in both data centres. The first experiments with Arcsys showed that a simple installation, programming, and configuration did not permit to read the objects on the LTO7 tapes.

Text, images, sound, moving images, web archiving, etc. For years, we were organized as a traditional hierarchical organization. \n\nDue to the complexity of operations and size of our organization, we were struggling with a myriad of stakeholders, which again led to challenges in prioritizing competing goals. Our IT resources were acting as a bottleneck, again suffering from constant context switching. Digital preservation was everyone's—and no one's—responsibility and was mostly viewed as an IT challenge.\n\nIn 2022, a new organizational structure was introduced. It established autonomous interdisciplinary product teams consisting of both IT resources and expert resources from the various media departments.\n\nAs part of this reorganization, digital preservation was established as a *product* at the National Library with its own team. The digital preservation team now develops digital preservation as a product and offers it as a service to other interdisciplinary teams in the organization.\n\nThis new team organization has led to a much more focused approach to digital preservation within the organization. Over the last year, we have made significant progress in the digital preservation field, establishing road maps, strategies, and principles, while reporting regularly to a \"board\" of product owners.\n\nWe would like to provide a brief overview of our previous challenges, our reorganization, and the beneficial impact that having a dedicated digital preservation team can have on an organization.","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["governance, resourcing, and management for dp","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-18T11:20:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13744311","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13744311","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13749573","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FD-lIrViKGWNpBR8inlhbkoudzx4OqY7IM5C7anGIn0/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/3c201d717da7420295f0ae90d0b0b1e9787aeff96d2548fb8552074190b13848"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Since 2021, I have personally maintained and grown a public Zotero bibliography of professional literature on the topic of emulation as a technological practice for digital preservation – a collection of citations and links that now includes references for about 200 conference papers (many of them from iPRES), journal articles, white papers, grant reports, books, blog posts, and more, published over a 30-year period stretching from (currently) 1992 to the present.\nWith this lightning talk, I hope to expand awareness and usage of this corpus for a key purpose: a better shared understanding of the history of our field and its practice. While this emulation bibliography provides vital resources for students and new professionals to build their skills and catch up on a robust area of technological research and development (and within itself containing micro-trends on potential sub-topics: emulation tooling, linked open data for emulation, emulation for archival access, emulation for curation, etc.), it also presents an opportunity for reflection for more seasoned practitioners: how far have we actually come over 30 years? What patterns have emerged in our writing, theory, and use cases for emulation? Are there gaps between the written record and actual lived experience of the field and its implemented practice? These are bigger questions than I can answer in the course of 5 minutes, but by simultaneously posing them and pointing to the means to engage further, I hope this lightning talk would also lay the groundwork for a more in-depth literature review or paper on the history of emulation practice in digital preservation at a future conference.","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["communications and advocacy for dp","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-17T15:45:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13685468","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13685468","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13685468","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RnqtK66DuBgEZBSuTMC7aU8i32AMZQUp5X-Qi1AQdNg/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/e14395c2e38544b884534e3ad374a2f5eb92a4bb791941e1ba0222a6c969343c"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Together, LAAWS and DART foster greater local control over the network infrastructure and make depositing content easier for users with little-to-no technical skill. By contributing to this centralized statewide preservation service, member institutions avoid redundant efforts, share resources, and make preservation more affordable for all.\n\nThis lightning talk centers on learnings from Phase One of our grant, which focused on identifying five geographically distributed LOCKSS server hosts, testing the new LAAWS documentation and installing the software, configuring DART, creating a deposit pathway between DART and LOCKSS, running deposit tests with partners, and documenting any challenges. Key takeaways include balancing aspirational vision with “on-the-ground” needs and costs, the importance of approaching “non-traditional” partners, managing relationships with collaborators, the value and challenges of local control, and how a network centered on cooperation, trust, and support can create easier “on ramps” to preservation and empower institutions to take more ownership of digital preservation. \n\nThe MDPN is - by all accounts from the LOCKSS Program - the first preservation network to use the LAAWS software across our entire production network infrastructure, and other institutions may find our experience useful. Although this case study focuses on our work in Michigan, the outcomes are relevant to a broad audience and could be replicated in many different contexts.\n\n\n  [1]: https://imls.gov/sites/default/files/project-proposals/LG-252394-OLS-22-full-proposal.pdf\n  [2]: https://www.lockss.org/about/frequently-asked-questions#laaws\n  [3]: https://aptrust.github.io/dart-docs/","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["governance, resourcing, and management for dp","scaling up"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-17T11:10:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13730565","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13730565","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13730565","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18q7nGVrhTj5qLOs3b-qg74krPB0yPTA0GoltsBuA2w0/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/bd35e0d952454965a64a917ee3741564b70655a27ed640c5aad0d31be3cee8ec"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

As is often the case in libraries, competing priorities may result in limited resources for strictly managing digital collections. Beyond making digital collections accessible, abstracting born digital and digitized collections into datasets for digital scholarship could pose a myriad of technical, legal, resource, and workflow challenges.   \n\nThe Library of Congress recognizes the critical need for determining and implementing a coordinated approach to support use of collections for digital scholarship, as outlined in the [Digital Collections Strategy][1]. Prior to and as a result of the strategy, options for advancing this work were explored through a variety of experiments, pilots, research reports, and working group discussions. \n\nThis year, the Library of Congress reached a major milestone in hiring its first Digital Collections Data Librarian to routinize the service of creating collections as data for researcher access.   \n\nThe Digital Collections Data Librarian works within the Library ’s Digital Collections Management and Services Division to centralize work and support computational use of the Library’s born digital and digitized collections and implement a coordinated approach to support use of collections as data for digital scholarship. \n\nThe Data Librarian is formalizing and enhancing previously piloted efforts to transform data from digital collections, including born digital content, digitized books, and web archives, into datasets ready for computational use. They are providing analysis and advice, and developing solutions to solve issues and problems associated with digital lifecycle management of collections and derived datasets.  \n\nFor the lightning talk, we will give an overview on how the position originated, onboarding and orientation efforts, projects underway and outcomes/accomplishments achieved within the first few months.

The GDELT project leverages some Google Cloud services to transcribe and translate these archived TV news collections and makes them more accessible. However, the amount of transcribed and translated text produced daily can be overwhelming for human consumption in its raw form. In this work we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize daily news and facilitate semantic search and question answering against the longitudinal index of the TV news archive.\n\nThe end-to-end pipeline of this process includes tasks of TV stream archiving, audio extraction, transcription, translation, chunking, vectorization, clustering, sampling, summarization, and representation. Translated transcripts are split into smaller chunks of about 30 seconds (a tunable parameter) with the assumption that this duration is neither too large to accommodate multiple concepts nor too small to fit only a partial concept discussed on TV. These chunks are treated as independent documents for which vector representations (or document embeddings) are created. These vectors are clustered using algorithms like KNN or DBSCAN to identify pieces of transcripts throughout the day that are repetitions of similar concepts. The centroid of each cluster is selected as the representative sample for their topics. GPT models are leveraged to summarize each sample. We have crafted a prompt that instructs the GPT model to synthesize the most prominent headlines, their descriptions, various types of classifications, and keywords/entities from provided transcripts.\n\nWe classify clusters to identify whether they represent ads or local-news that might not be of the interest of the international audience. After excluding unnecessary clusters, the interactive summary of each headline is rendered in a web application. We also maintain metadata of each chunk (video IDs and timestamps) that we use in the representation to embed a corresponding small part of the archived video for reference.\n\nFurthermore, valuable chunks of transcripts and associated metadata are stored in a vector database to facilitate semantic search and LLM-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).\n\nWe have deployed a test instance of our experiment and open-sourced our implementation (https://github.com/internetarchive/newsum).","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["information technology for dp","from document to data"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-18T11:15:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13742797","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13742797","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13742797","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b42Bd_pn9__lo1qwjKqh3fB46M9Dt_1hjO4ATMggwvg/edit#heading=h.3motvki8sysj","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/c4ff0ba130054fff8dfd6d0fb3f33463d66167c2df83459e89304b6b9778c302"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Various groups amongst the organisers have for many months been discussing and planning how this might manifest itself at the conference... and beyond. Early in in the discussions it became apparent that there was a strong desire to leave a lasting legacy in the region, a digital preservation community of practice to keep fanning the flame of digital presentation interest that (hopefully) would be ignited through localised activities at the conference.\n\nDiscussions around how this might be achieved have exposed hitherto unexpected (or at least unsurfaced) problems that would need to be overcome. Problems such as who exactly would the target audience be; how could they be reached; how we could make the case for digital preservation to them when they may not even realise that they had a problem; how could we get them to attend the proposed sessions at the conference; how could they afford to attend; and, perhaps most importantly, what steps would need to be taken to ensure a community of practice didn’t wither and die post conference.\n\nLuckily, the collective iPRES brain has been able to come up with some answers to some of these questions. We would like to pass on these learnings to the community. This lightning talk (and accompanying poster) outlines the problems we have encountered and the (potential) solutions we will be employing to achieve the stated aim of leaving an iPRES legacy behind us.","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["communications and advocacy for dp","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Zero (CC0-1.0)","date":"2024-09-18T13:40:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13763625","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13763625","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13763625","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MToYP8iGZoTWR3l_d6IHQm8iNRXr1ozm5lJNA9ercLM/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/3ec04ee9969c4ac48501aa9100cd6f752a2085cce7cc414588e4c6fc22f07e98"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Anyone curious about emulation or preserving access to software or born-digital collections is welcome and encouraged to participate. \n\nThe emerging EaaSI Research Alliance—an international community of libraries, archives, and museums using the Emulation-as-a-Service Infrastructure (EaaSI) software—offers a promising opportunity to bolster international cooperation and expand adoption of emulation as a method of preserving access to software and software-dependent collections. In this session, representatives from the Alliance and the Software Preservation Network will facilitate in-person and remote participants through a series of gently structured conversations designed to foster connections and make space for everyone to contribute. \n\nAfter a quick introduction to ground the session, participants will break into groups based on geography and organization type (including space for students and jobseekers).  These small group discussions will support networking within and outside of geographic and organizational definitions, leveraging common context while also imagining beyond boundaries. Because the formation of lasting collaborations is a key aim, it would be ideal to have time for two rounds of conversations: geographically-based, supporting coordination within intellectual property regimes, and institution-type-based, supporting cross-border cooperation among organizations with similar missions. \n\nThe prompts used in the discussions will illuminate emulation-related points of alignment and difference, including salient use cases and challenges related to operational, technical, usability, climate impact, or intellectual property concerns. Each group will have a designated facilitator from the session team and a pre-identified notetaker. To support remote participation, each in-person group will also have a corresponding virtual breakout room with a pre-identified facilitator and notetaker. \n\nThe organizers will use notes from the session to write a report for the conference proceedings and to articulate a potential set of emulation-related strategic priorities for the emerging EaaSI Research Alliance, Software Preservation Network, iPRES community, and stakeholder communities of practice.

This lightning talk, \"Whose Knowledge Counts?: Decolonisation of Knowledge for Digital Preservation and Sustainability of Indigenous Knowledge in Africa,\" addresses the critical need for inclusive digital preservation policies and practices that authentically represent Indigenous voices and perspectives.\n\nThe current findings in South Africa, reveal significant gaps in digital preservation policies for Indigenous knowledge systems (IKS) in Africa. Indigenous knowledge owners lack effective mechanisms and policies for long-term digital preservation. Although some African countries have initiated policies to manage Indigenous knowledge, there is often a lack of meaningful engagement with Indigenous communities, resulting in insufficient representation and benefits for these communities.\n\nIn Kenya, we have mapped Indigenous knowledge holders, community archives, libraries and museums in Elgeyo Marakwet County. The county leadership has embraced stakeholder involvement in digital preservation and conservation efforts, setting a precedent for community-driven initiatives in Indigenous knowledge preservation. Despite these efforts, the lack of standardized metadata for Indigenous knowledge systems hinders the accessibility and integration of local knowledge into digital preservation frameworks for more than 90 community libraries, museums, traditional medical centers, botanic gardens, cultural sites within the Keiyo and Marakwet communities of Kenya.\n\nWe have used application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, such as ChatGPT, Bing AI, and Gemini AI, which presents a promising opportunity for decolonizing knowledge and addressing metadata challenges in the global ecosystem. The AI tools can facilitate the identification, creation, discovery, access, organization, dissemination, and preservation of Indigenous knowledge. However, there is a critical need for sustained investment in local and Indigenous knowledge systems, digital inclusion and skill development to ensure that Indigenous knowledge is accurately and respectfully preserved and integrated into the global information and knowledge ecosystem. This talk showcases the ongoing partnerships between local and global stakeholders to develop inclusive and sustainable digital preservation strategies for Indigenous knowledge in Africa.","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["governance, resourcing, and management for dp","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-19T13:35:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13740956","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13740956","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13740956","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TyATX9tJYvyL0Wx572QwHZp_tsNIPyhOnbkEfnzDWsg/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/39b5cc9339dd420390d83022ae284d235f4c5b9bb78642ff921353395beda4f1"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}
{"title":"A Generic Carbon Footprint Model","url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/ipres/ipres-2024/papers/a-generic-carbon-footprint-model/","creators":["Mikko Tiainen"],"abstract":"We have previously reported the carbon footprint calculations for the National Digital Preservation Services in Finland, e.g. as a short paper in iPRES 2023. We have found out in our calculations that the carbon footprint for the hardware, including both manufacturing, transportation and disposal costs, has a profound impact on the total carbon footprint of our service platform. In our platform, the hardware component carbon footprint is much greater that the service life carbon footprint (electricity consumption). Now it is time to expand our carbon footprint calculations and create a generic model for calculating the footprint in cases where hardware manufacturers do not report the in-body carbon footprint (includes hardware manufacturing, logistics and disposal) figures for their hardware.\n\nThe basic assumption is that all servers, regardless of the manufacturer, share components which have an in-body carbon footprint reported by at least one vendor. We will turn this sparse matrix for server component in-body carbon footprint values into a generic server components in-body carbon footprint calculation. This generic calculation is estimated to be fairly accurate and the goal is to develop this into an open model for hardware component carbon footprint calculation. This model would be highly beneficial to the digital preservation community in general, as it could be used by any producer of a digital preservation service to calculate their hardware component carbon footprint, without having to have separate in-depth discussions with their hardware manufacturers.\n\nSince the previous report from 2023, the National Digital Preservation Services have expanded the platform to 7.5 Petabytes and the server manufacturer has been changed from HPE to Kaytus. At the same time the Kaytus hardware lifespan has been extended into 7 years. We have also replaced one data centre, the new data centre having a PUE of 1.05 while the previous data centre had a PUE of 1.66. This poster will use our current digital preservation platform, allowing for up to 7.5 Petabytes of data, as an example when creating a generic carbon footprint calculation using the previous assumptions detailed above.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["legal and social responsibilities for dp","scaling up"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-19T13:30:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13683021","citation_pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V1U-5fV739ByESM2QmVNVepTaCT4YQUh/view?usp=drive_link"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

To be able to guarantee that ingested contents can be usable, the DPS has together with the utilizing partner organizations decided on a set of supported file formats. The files have to be valid, and both file format identification and validation are performed when ingesting the content to the DPS.\n\nIt is generally better to fix broken files as early as possible, as ingesting content to the DPS can occur at a later stage. To support partner organizations and foster digital content management expertise the DPS has published a public online file validator at: https://validation.digitalpreservation.fi/#/en\n\nThe user can upload files to the validator, which performs file format identification, technical metadata extraction and validation on the file. The validator also reports file format support in our DPS. The user can download a detailed validation report, including all collected metadata, in a JSON format.\n\nThe validator uses the same validation tools as our DPS ingest. The tool is a Python tool developed in-house called file-scraper: https://github.com/Digital-Preservation-Finland/file-scraper. File-scraper is a framework that uses several third-party and in-house tools, such as Open Preservation Foundation tools JHOVE, Fido, veraPDF and Jpylyzer, and various others, such as XmlLint, ExifTool, ImageMagick, FFmpeg, for identifying formats, collecting metadata, and validating. File-scraper detects the file-format and collects metadata based on a pre-set of tools called detectors. After, another set of tools is selected as validators based on the detected file format. Different file formats are thus validated using a different set of tools, and many formats are validated using several tools. For example, PDF/A is validated by JHOVE, veraPDF and Ghostscript, while WAVE is validated using JHOVE and FFmpeg. The metadata from all used tools, the well-formedness, and support in the DPS is harmonized into a JSON output.\n\nThe validator has been helpful in fostering digital content management and helping organizations perform digital preservation actions early on in the life cycle of the contents. This validator is helpful in ensuring the preservation of digital content and lowering the threshold of the ingest process.","full_text":null,"type":"tool demo","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-18T15:55:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tm1sitP5zYVYM6s5NoVLPnb0qA0Zyc-Nx0HOj5APixU/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/4d45be085fff4ea5afe21bd5121530e941e01b90f3204f9cb130fb3682839751"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Through a sequence of meetings, engagements, a contextual overview paper, an open consultation and a final report with recommendations the group identified gaps and proposed actions. The key gap, which impacts the development of essential knowledge about roles and costs, is the uneven distribution of awareness within EOSC and beyond that active preservation requires a long term commitment to data management that must adjust to changing technologies and the changing needs of users. Progress on gap analysis issues included the recognition of the emerging need for more concrete and clearly defined sets of activities and functions for repositories, and the validation of the CoreTrustSeal proposed levels of curation and preservation care. Together these and the recommendations can support a move towards clearer typologies of repositories and their levels of speciality, responsibility, curation and preservation. \nThe resources provide bite-sized contextual assertions that can be reused by actors at all levels from researchers and practitioners to funders and policy makers. There are clear calls to action that are applicable to a range of actors and that guide a cascade of progress from European, to national to institutional level. The materials address FAIR data, trustworthy digital repositories (TDR), standards, assessment, certification, transparency, sustainability  and future project and network routes to collaboration and progress. Together these provide an insight to infrastructures and institutions seeking to deliver, mature and scale complex services with restrained resources. \nAttendees will be provided with insight into the context of this EOSC-A task force and its key findings and about how they can engage with and contribute to follow up initiatives.","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["governance, resourcing, and management for dp","scaling up"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-19T11:10:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13741260","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13741260","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13741260","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hf-VavCLYwGskk3JdDbnPOALZtP2Yd4w2pe_5Evkxg8/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/95ca2a083ac641f99b58185549d7c5407e49ac128c9e45efb96d32698a8f023a"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Does it have a place in digital preservation?\n•\t**Trust**—This has many levels of complexity. We’re all familiar with the authenticity problem (how can we guarantee that information we’re preserving is the same [or provides the same experience] over the long term), but what about the trustworthiness of the information in the first place?

The presentation will focus on the complexity of the workflow, the expandability, scalability, and the open issue of data monitoring.\n\nAs part of the Digital Memory project, a platform was built to enable information repositories to benefit from a centralized Preservation Service where system managers can initiate preservation pipelines and view the state of already archived records. After agreeing on a protocol, the platform can harvest data from the different repositories, transform them for long-term preservation, and store them on CERN Cloud storage (EOS). The preservation process includes different steps: validation of SIPs, normalization, and other micro-services (through Archivematica), storage on magnetic tapes, and publishing in a central registry.\n\nThe initial focal point of the project was to be able to harvest different sources of data; to achieve that, we designed an expandable architecture. Since then we have adapted to numerous repositories including InvenioRDM instances, CodiMD, GitLab, and Indico.\nAnother important aspect was scalability: depending on the collection the workload can be significant, therefore the platform mostly consists of async processes that can run in parallel. To help with resilience the records can be filtered based on the executed steps and status. Our Archivematica instance is deployed on OpenShift where the number of worker clients and available resources can be increased on demand.\n\nMonitoring and appraisal are still open issues we are working on. Monitoring of already harvested records means retriggering the preservation pipeline if the data change is significant enough to justify the reprocessing. So far, the platform and registry are designed to support multiple versions of an AIP, but we intend to optimize storage by minimizing the redundancy. \nFinally, to evaluate if submitted data is part of CERN's official preservation scope, we plan to include internal expert users in the process, who would be aided by a trained model.\n\n<img src=\"https://digital-memory-project.web.cern.ch/sites/default/files/inline-images/preserve_flow.jpeg\" width=\"700\" alt=\"CERN Preserve workflow\">","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["information technology for dp","scaling up"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-19T11:15:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13646193","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13646193","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13646193","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hf-VavCLYwGskk3JdDbnPOALZtP2Yd4w2pe_5Evkxg8/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/95ca2a083ac641f99b58185549d7c5407e49ac128c9e45efb96d32698a8f023a"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Digital preservation is an active process involving the ongoing use of computer systems and data storage.  This involves physical infrastructure and ICT equipment, the need for power and cooling, and a cycle of migrations and renewal.  All of which generate carbon emissions, not just from energy consumption but also as a result of the embodied footprint from the manufacture, transportation and eventual disposal of the ICT equipment involved.  But how big is this footprint?  What aspects of digital preservation contribute most such as ingest or long-term storage?  How do emissions depend on the type of content being preserved, what preservation actions are performed, and where preservation takes place such as in the cloud?  Without being able to measure and calculate carbon emissions, it is hard to work out how best to reduce these emissions, or indeed whether other organisational activities offer lower hanging fruit.   This poster explores these areas, presents a methodology for measuring carbon emissions of digital preservation, and gives some real numbers from large scale digital preservation in the cloud using real data for a range of digital preservation scenarios.   The poster includes debunking a few misconceptions about the carbon footprint of energy consumption, especially in the cloud, it directs attention to the elephant in the room that is the embodied footprint of ICT equipment (servers and storage) that form the mainstay of digital preservation systems and infrastructure, and it provides some practical suggestions on how to reduce emissions.   The overall aim of the poster is to help people understand how they can measure the carbon footprint of their digital preservation activities, how they can understand what aspects and activities contribute the most, and how they can make their own informed decisions on how to make effective reductions.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["legal and social responsibilities for dp","scaling up"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-17T13:30:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13682874","citation_pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UIw99uOzpxoxNIebXfTJJyaTAnXm5aRR/view?usp=drive_link","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bukG4bEvICUzC-Fp3KAcHmq2wRuqU8x67PRAuX-RwR4/","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/34ffa848513a49b58e2aa3536113622690d1c56176a14334a332f184acbb8e29"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

These digitised or born digital archives derive from various sources, are very heterogeneous, consist of multiple (sometimes new or exotic) formats and contain more often than not complex digital objects. An extra challenge is the sometimes limited capacity and digital maturity  within these organisations.\n\n**How can we organise the intake of these diverse digitised or digital born archives into the MAM of meemoo in an efficient, user-friendly and affordable way?** We were in need of a new and improved process for this digital intake which could tackle the above mentioned challenges. In this lightning talk, I would like to present the steps we took, like functional and technical analysis, internal brainstorms, focus talks with our content partners, implementing the E-ARK SIP, etc., and the outcomes. We were particularly looking for a solution regarding the pre-ingest processes, for example cleaning, selecting and structuring the data by our content partners, and the creation of E-ARK compliant  SIPs.\n\nTo conclude, I will present some **lessons learned**, give a **status update** (where are we now) and say something about the **next steps** (where do we want to be). By September, we will be a lot further than we are now, but I can already say that we will certainly develop **tooling** for the creation and validation of E-ARK SIPs.\n\nI would afterwards love to hear from fellow participants about their experiences and lessons learned regarding the intake of heterogeneous digital archival collections!","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["information management principles","scaling up"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-19T13:45:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13683403","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13683403","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13683403","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lDWYct0heJztUyK5nOaDaLFRBO-Yx4PXT5URfiK3xZo/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/fac102093df84a8c93031824fad34cd95d7f83fd04574b0884545e07bee9e47f"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Regarding digital materials, the NDL has formulated the \"Basic Plan for Digital Preservation of National Diet Library’s Collections for 2021-2025\" and has been working on research and practice for digital preservation. The NDL is currently digitizing and migrating its collections, and as part of this process, a large-scale migration of about 10,000 optical discs was conducted in FY2023.\nThe migration mainly targeted CDs of book supplements published in Japan up to the year 2000. The types of discs were diverse and included CD-ROMs that simply stored a few files, audio CDs, hybrid CDs, and relatively early DVD-Video (DVD players began to be produced in 1996), as well as optical discs containing large numbers of files with programs like databases.\nIn order to migrate these diverse discs efficiently, we designed a workflow that classifies discs in advance and extracts data in a manner appropriate for each type of disc format. Optical discs were classified into three main categories: optical discs for simply copying files, for extracting audio tracks only, and for imaging in ISO format. It was confirmed that the method of imaging everything regardless of disc’s type was the most efficient for migration work, although there were many technical issues in searching and using the contents of image files.\nIn addition, in this work, all optical discs were subjected to an error check equivalent to ISO/IEC 18630:2023 before the data extraction. As a result, it was confirmed that, especially for audio CDs, there was a correlation between high error values and noise in the migration results. Therefore, we found that the appropriate use of error check can improve the efficiency of quality inspection of audio CD migration.\nIn this poster, we will report on the issues and propose an efficient technical method for the migration of various optical discs published more than a quarter of a century ago.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["information technology for dp","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-19T13:30:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13641209","citation_pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z4HHMVTKxESmZIdZr_pCq8QBuyHu3T0X/view?usp=drive_link"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

(Technical) maintenance and further development responsibilities lie with the Open Preservation Foundation (OPF).\nWhile there is already documentation available on the OPF’s website in the form of release notes, user guides, and guides per module, there is also room for improvement. Notably, there has been a surge in interest within the past few years regarding the interpretation of JHOVE error and warning messages, particularly when confronted with malformed or invalid information objects. \nTo address this burgeoning interest and cater to the needs of the digital preservation community, the establishment of a specialised interest group focusing on the use of JHOVE is proposed. The aim of the group is to develop, provide and maintain comprehensive documentation on interpreting JHOVE messages effectively and share our experiences and the possible issues we run into.\nIn this BoF session, community input is sought to shape the direction of the JHOVE Special Interest Group (SIG).

Of course, it all starts with preserving our digital heritage in the long term for our designated communities to find. We as a community have to help them find the information taking into account their knowledge base, needs and wishes.\nBut on the downside, this storage and use of digital data costs: it produces carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. It has an impact on our environment. \nA few years ago, the Dutch Digital Heritage Network started a climate awareness campaign. \nIn talking to heritage organizations we realized a few things:\n\n - List item\n\nClimate awareness grows and from within: a few colleagues that are ‘green minded’ meet up and campaign their cause within the organization. \n\n - List item\n\nSome heritage organizations are already taking positive climate measures: they are reusing exhibition materials, stimulating visitors to take public transport or bike to the museum, greening their buildings and depots. \n\n - List item\n\nThe large impact of IT is not always noticed or taken into account. And if it is, you are faced with dilemma’s like servicing your online users in a different or slower manner or be more selective in preserving data or documents(no endless copies). \n\n - List item\n\nThere is a need for more solid, trustworthy information: what are the numbers or figures around climate impact. \n\nSo how do we get on with the campaign? We hope to keep the conversation going within the network. We publish guides about organizing and establishing a greener IT environment in your organization, e.g. making your websites more sustainable. We have a green techwatcher on board blogging about storage, green software, user dilemma’s and AI. We share tips and challenges and organize a few events about greener IT. \nThis lightning talk will show some of our results within the Dutch Digital Heritage Network but will hopefully and more importantly keep the conversation going about climate impact and how to tackle this within the preservation community.

Quarantine and condition checks are a crucial part of the preservation process, ensuring that newly acquired storage media do not introduce contaminants that could harm existing collections; and that computer storage is stored, handled, and transported in a way that minimises the risk of damage or data loss.\n\nThe poster covers requirements and recommendations for five broad categories of storage media typically found in archival collections: magnetic disks, floppy disks, optical media, cassettes and tapes, and solid state. For each category, information is provided on the types of media covered as well as recommendations on the optimal environmental conditions for long-term storage. Further guidelines cover various aspects of proper media handling, best ways to safely store, visual inspections, transportation, acclimatisation, and labelling. \n\nThis work collates and distils relevant information in British Standards BS-4783; includes updates and guidelines from the digital preservation and archiving community; and incorporates previously unpublished practice and expertise amassed in the 25 years since ASC began to collect computer storage media. It serves as a valuable resource for anyone involved in the acquisition, storage, and preservation of computer storage media in archival collections.

In this project, meemoo processed 170.000 hours of audiovisual archives using speech-to-text, named entity recognition and face recognition. We created time-based metadata identifying people, locations and organisations in audio and video. Where possible, metadata are linked to open linked authorities, such as wikidata. Over 120 partners were involved in the project, from various sectors such as digital heritage, city archives, museums and political archives. Part of this talk will be dedicated to how we involved these partners into the new but also very challenging field of creating metadata through AI. \n\nThe lightning talk is not intended as a deep dive into technical matters. We will highlight the obtained results and discuss the quality of obtained result. But more importantly, we will explain why and how we decided to build certain components, such as face recognition, while opting to procure speech-to-text and NER services. This should give the audience an idea of the decision processes behind working with AI tooling to create descriptive metadata. We will also briefly touch the ethical and legal challenges we encountered, share insights that came out of the project.\n\nLastly we will end the talk by looking at the future and share the questions that we still have and need to tackle next.

This core set of requirements was based upon the requirements in the DPC’s procurement toolkit (https://www.dpconline.org/digipres/implement-digipres/core-requirements-for-a-digital-preservation-system). In the course of our discussions, when identifying the requirements, the question of a definition of a digital preservation solution arose. There are many definitions of digital preservation (my favourite short one is “keeping digital stuff usable”), but none for a digital preservation solution (at least not that I’ve found). A facetious response could be “A digital preservation solution enables you to keep digital stuff usable”, but that’s not really very helpful when it comes to procuring a system. \n\nSo, what defines a digital preservation solution? We know it’s a sliding scale (with very blurred lines). Most would probably agree that backup isn’t digital preservation, but what about dark archives? They keep stuff usable in the short term, but without format migration could they really be described as proper digital preservation? Are there other decision points/getaways where on the one side there are systems that are digital preservation solutions and on the other side there are systems that don’t make the grade - sheep on the right, goats on the left.\n\nWe're interested in the communities take on this. Many people have strong opinions around definitions.

The issue is currently under discussion at an international level (e.g. DeBauche et al., 2023 [iPRES], regarding French institutions: Ville, 2023). Even in German-speaking countries there are studies focussing on specific issues (e.g. Benauer, 2022), but comprehensive research addressing the various challenges has yet to be conducted.\n\n**Study** \nTaking this situation into account, I sent out an online-questionnaire in April 2024 to the specialist communities of Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Luxembourg. Distribution channels were six relevant mailing lists. The survey provides the data basis for my current master's thesis (submission in June 2024 in Library and Information Science, Humboldt University of Berlin). The aim is to determine the current challenges and perspectives of email processing. 187 participants voted, of which 115 questionnaires are evaluable. Challenges were captured with qualitative methods (survey coding). \n\n**Objective of the poster contribution**\nI would like to present the results at iPRES and also involve the international community. I aim to enhance participation with an interactive poster that includes a Mentimeter survey. This will not only provide insights into the unique challenges of email archiving in German-speaking countries but also extend the discussion to the international community, fostering a dialogue for making informed, long-term decisions in the field.\n\nNo specialised knowledge is required.

Organizations are faced with many challenges managing the technical infrastructure needed for their digital preservation storage. The National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA) Storage Survey Working Group conducted a survey in 2023 to gain an understanding of how organizations around the world manage digital preservation storage. Responses were received from 14 countries. The goal of this longitudinal study was to gather information on how new technologies and standards have impacted preservation storage and to compare results to the previous data collected in 2011, 2013, and 2019.\nThe survey working group reviewed questions from the previous three surveys, retaining as many questions as feasible while removing or revising those that were no longer pertinent and adding questions on current concerns, including environmental impact. The questions were thematically grouped in five sections: General Storage Environments; Geographically Distributed Copies; Preservation Storage Requirements and Services; Preservation Planning and Organizational Commitment; and Demographics.\nThe poster will share current trends based on key findings from the survey, including a shift away from collaborative storage models compared to previous surveys, an increase in the use of commercial cloud storage, and a greater acceptance of the use of cloud storage. The full report features a breakdown of specific cloud storage services used by institution type, statistics on self-hosting vs. outsourcing when managing digital preservation and the types of services performed, as well as information on amounts of digital storage used and plans for meeting future needs. New to the 2023 survey are questions about environmental impact, where respondents gave practical suggestions to lessen environmental impact while collections continue to grow. \nAnyone working with digital content inevitably confronts the challenge of escalating storage demands, which frequently surpass available resources.  Examining prevailing trends and learning others’ approaches to digital preservation storage can provide valuable insight, tangible examples, and facilitate the identification of shared goals and objectives, aiding in advocacy efforts.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["information technology for dp","scaling up"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-18T13:30:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13648690","citation_pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A2ONCkxhqFewBnI5FqC5ZC9EGFsPUiO2/view?usp=drive_link"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

However, one aspect that is not often addressed is the verification of the completeness of these holdings.\nWith this lightning talk, the Publications Office will share its experience on how it ensures that the collections it archives are complete.\nThe Publications Office of the EU is the central point of access to EU law, as well as to publications, open data, research results, procurement notices and other official information. It plays at the same time the roles of a publishing house, a legal depository and an archive for the publications authored by the EU institutions. Among its digital collections, the ‘Official Journal of the European Union’ occupies a central place, as the digital version is legally binding since July 2013, replacing the paper edition. It thus requires particular attention in terms of authenticity and completeness.\nUntil now, the control of the completeness was ensured by a list established at the entrance of the archive. The filenames and checksums of all the documents ingested in the long-term preservation repository are kept in a list that is regularly compared to the inventory of the assets contained in the repository, and to their index. This way, we check if all ingested documents are still present over time and after preservation actions such as migrations, media refreshes, etc.\nRecently, we made a significant change to our IT architecture by creating a reference list that is physically and conceptually separate from the archiving workflow. Most importantly, this list is fed at the entrance of the documents into the dissemination repository, i.e. at the moment where they are published (and not when they are archived). With this change, we can carry out a regular check that our archival assets are complete and intact, by comparing the filenames and checksums from the inventory to those of this new reference list. \nIn short, we have established a reference list that tells the archive what it SHOULD contain, and no longer simply what the archive has received.","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-19T13:50:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13743379","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13743379","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13743379","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lDWYct0heJztUyK5nOaDaLFRBO-Yx4PXT5URfiK3xZo/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/fac102093df84a8c93031824fad34cd95d7f83fd04574b0884545e07bee9e47f"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

{"title":"Charting the Future: ICPSR's 20+ Years of Digital Preservation and Beyond","url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/ipres/ipres-2024/papers/charting-the-future-icpsr-s-20-years-of-digital-preservation-and/","creators":["Jared Lyle","Mike Shallcross"],"abstract":"The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), the world’s largest social science data repository, developed its formal digital preservation program ~20 years ago, around the same time as the start of the iPRES conference.  While ICPSR had conducted preservation activities since its founding in 1962, it conscientiously professionalized and standardized digital preservation work after the recommendation of a 2004 external process review committee report.\n\nThis poster reviews the 20 years of digital preservation progress at ICPSR, especially highlighting upcoming funded work to modernize processes and technology to better align with responsibilities for Trustworthy Digital Repositories specified in ISO 14721 (Open Archival Information System Reference Model) and in ISO 16363 (Audit and Certification of Trustworthy Digital Repositories).  Upcoming work includes:\n\n**Data Provenance Information**: improvement of ICPSR’s ability to track preservation actions performed on digital objects across the curation lifecycle, from deposit as Submission Information Packages through storage as Archival Information Packages. This effort includes improved documentation of relationships between original files and their associated preservation and access copies.\n\n\n**File Format Identification**: integration of tools that make use of the PRONOM format registry to provide more granular and accurate information regarding the file formats of deposited data. In the case of data formats where PRONOM contains limited information or is unable to distinguish between format versions (e.g., SAS, SPSS, STATA, etc.), ICPSR intends to contribute format signature information for the benefit of the research data community.\n\n\n**Technical Metadata Extraction**: expand the range of format-specific technical metadata collected by ICPSR (e.g., as defined by community resources such as the FADGI Significant Properties for Digital Video) so that this information can be made available to users (to assist with the evaluation and selection of content of interest) as well as staff (to assist with risk mediation and preservation planning).\n\n\n**Metadata Interoperability**: development of a new API that will allow essential descriptive and administrative metadata about ICPSR data collections to be exported in established standards (e.g., DCAT-US, MARCXML, DDI-Codebook, Dublin Core, schema.org, etc.) to promote discovery, catalog integration, and (eventually) content transfer.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-18T15:30:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13704260","citation_pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P_EJicXlQT4AhWW-6wyw5iODYWw0Uahr/view?usp=drive_link"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The Z-100 was released by Zenith Data Systems and Heathkit in 1982.  Although it was contemporary with IBM's 5150, the ancestor of modern PCs, it is not PC-compatible, and Z-100 software can only run on that computer.  Due to the dwindling number of extent Z-100s, and the absence until now of any emulator to run Z-100 programs, a vast corpus of Z-100 data is irretrievable.\n\nDespite similarities to the PC, such as the same processor and a variant of Microsoft DOS (\"Z-DOS\"), the Z-100 had many idiosyncrasies, including memory-mapped video, a second processor, and its own BIOS, ports, and interrupts.  Its video, highly advanced for the time, led to its adoption by the US Air Force and Clarkson University [3].  Much creative work was developed on this computer, including games, utilities, documents, spreadsheets, and blueprints.  Z-100 disks can be read by a modern PC with a 5 1/4\" drive; however, Z-100 programs will not run on a PC or existing emulator, and word-processing save files, BASIC files, and spreadsheets are saved in compressed, proprietary formats unreadable without their original programs.\n\nOur Z-100 emulator, posted publicly [1], models all of the system necessary to boot Z-DOS and run many Z-100 programs.  We modeled the processors, glue logic, video, and the wrote the first timing-accurate simulation of the WD1797 floppy controller.  We tested using a monitor ROM and floppy disk images from a Z-100 in our possession.  Our emulator runs Z-DOS, most of the Z-DOS core utilities, the GALAHAD word processor, the Multiplan spreadsheet program, and Z-BASIC.  We tested disk images containing BASIC games, spreadsheets, and word documents, all saved in proprietary formats previously unreadable.  Our emulated programs opened all these data files successfully and allowed us to extract them to text files.\n\n[1] http://www.github.com/mdblack/Zenith-Z-100\n[2] Matta, \"A Zenith Z-100 Emulator\", MS Thesis, Bridgewater State University, 2021.\n[3] \"Clarkson College to Issue Computers to Student Body\".

This presentation addresses these issues by examining specific case studies below that illustrate the complexities and solutions in preserving data related to research activities. Additionally, it will discuss the growing focus on management practices, the establishment of institutional policies, and the development of project-specific Data Management Plans (DMPs).\n\nDigital Humanities Research Data: This involves preserving text analysis and visualization scripts, as well as copyrighted content used as source data. Focus points include how to preserve and pass down complex algorithms beyond mere data organization, handle the migration of outdated visualization scripts, and manage copyright issues, including permission applications.\n\nLinked Data and IIIF Data: This example covers databases and digital archives in the form of Linked Data and IIIF. In the background, we have original data in CSV format, transformed RDF/Turtle, and images, along with the scripts used for data organization and conversion. Key challenges include handling relatively large datasets, managing data that falls under institutional responsibility beyond individual researchers or projects, and preserving the history of data organization and interpretation despite the difficulties in drawing clear boundaries between them.\n\nData related to research activities should include not only research outputs, processes, and underlying resources but also documents related to the administration of research communities. This approach ensures the transparency of research practices at the community level and conveys this transparency to future generations. As an example, I will introduce the translation of documents related to research integrity, highlighting the role of web archiving technology.\n\nTo bridge generations of researchers, it is essential to develop methodologies that ensure the longevity and semantic consistency of preserved data. By exploring these case studies, we aim to identify the necessary steps and tools required to maintain the accessibility and interoperability of research data. Additionally, by considering the roles of projects and institutions, we can better ensure the successful transmission of data across generations, thus fostering a more collaborative and inclusive research environment.","full_text":null,"type":"poster","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","from document to data"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-19T09:00:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13756258","citation_pdf_url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HxC6T4sVifq1IGSJuOrh2FcNSRrYMQDT/view?usp=drive_link"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

Roofs are leaking, and water is relentlessly damaging precious documents that hold the keys to our history. The memories of our people, stored in these fragile repositories, are fading away with every passing day.\nBut this isn't just a loss of the past—it's a significant impediment to our future. A nation that cannot remember where it came from cannot navigate where it is going. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which aim to create a better and more sustainable future for all, rely heavily on a country's ability to learn from its history, adapt, and innovate. Without preserving our memories, our progress towards these goals is severely hindered.\nHowever, there is hope. Digital preservation offers a beacon of light in these dark times. By converting our physical archives into digital formats, we can protect them from the elements and ensure their longevity. Digital archives can be easily replicated and stored in multiple locations, providing a safeguard against disasters that could otherwise erase our history.\nYet, the task ahead is monumental and cannot be achieved in isolation. We are bleeding for partnerships—collaborations with governmental bodies, private sectors, international organizations, and passionate individuals. Together, we can pool resources, share expertise, and develop innovative solutions to preserve Nigeria's memories.","full_text":null,"type":"lightning talk","categories":null,"keywords":["legal and social responsibilities for dp","scaling up"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-18T15:45:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_public_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13685954","citation_pdf_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13685954","citation_conference_slides_url":"https://zenodo.org/records/13762758","citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1coSQGZ5jVNK0VwwLWUyBu-JIkNkKuQH-qHnOUyj_KzA/edit#heading=h.ge8kdqo3zbiz","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/b27936ff02184e1fbce3a6cbad4e50932f2972e78ce34bdf91e5c1f936647db4"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

The technology was demonstrated in 2023 via an end-to-end prototype in a data center rack size form factor. The technology uses Ceramic-on-glass sheets as media. These are stacked inside of LTO-shaped cartridges leveraging tape automation infrastructure. Cerabyte data storage withstands a number of threat scenarios and does not exhibit bit rot even at extreme temperatures or intense UV or radiation exposure. Femtosecond lasers are used to punch holes in the ceramic layer encoding the data in matrices, high-speed microscope cameras enable the readback of the data.\n\nFor the bake-off Session we will dip a Cerabyte data carrier repeatedly into boiling water and then bake (!) it in a hot pizza-oven (together with a piece of pizza!) and then let it cool down and read the data carrier with a handheld digital microscope projected to a monitor. The coding will be done with QR-codes which then the audience could read out with their QR reader from their own smartphones (even in flight-mode!)\n\nCerabyte is a storage medium that is agnostic to whatever file format is saved on Cerabyte.","full_text":null,"type":"tool demo","categories":null,"keywords":["approaches to preservation","start 2 preserve"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 (CC-BY-SA-4.0)","date":"2024-09-18T13:35:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oGwEZLx1UYUbtMQ5Y_bsh7skzl1XkOIDvzMjo2NBDSI/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/455bf375e860488394867726471cd880363eb1e08e0c430b93d4a756efde7bc3"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

This entry is done by creating a Submission Information Package (SIP). In practice, this involves a .zip file that consists of a metadata file (conforming to our metadata scheme and the dossiers and items themselves. The creation and uploading of SIPs in the E-depot will be simplified because the customer can easily map their own metadata model to the DAV model, automatically read and fill in metadata in the metadata file, generate SIPs that comply with the requirements of the E-depot, and finally place the SIP on the customer's FTPS environment, after which it is picked up by the E-depot.\n\nThe first phase of the tool was created out of necessity: our clients often have to re-upload a SIP because various errors were made against our metadata model. With our SIP-Creator application we want to prevent those errors and streamline their ingest workflow. By the iPRES event, we will have completed our second phase of development. The second phase will be focused on the ingest of descriptions for analogue archive into our E-depot. This is needed because both digital material and analogue descriptions are housed in the same environment and described and accessed according to the same standard.","full_text":null,"type":"tool demo","categories":null,"keywords":["information technology for dp","from document to data"],"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0)","date":"2024-09-18T11:35:00+01:00","weight":null,"metadata":{"citation_conference_title":"iPRES 2024"},"links":{"citation_conference_notes_url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tSJimjLpVuNNMjbB3KZ5gPwYh7j3jrlWt1Vjsygx4yc/edit#heading=h.aar4tupij1po","citation_conference_recording_url":"https://www.archief.vlaanderen.be/archief/records/dossiers/5acb210228ce4315ae650812d056a482329eb83ed2dc42398a51505dc153be81/documents/3c14f516b3bb42e6808a7c66fd54429b36d34b3d55634a3fb48a382b6aaa18f0"},"language":"en","source":"iPRES","source_url":"https://www.digipres.org/publications/"}

We also manage the influx of their existing digital collections into our archive system, where the content is sustainably preserved. However, most material has almost no metadata attached, making it unfindable. Therefore, we have developed an AI-metadata pipeline that automatically adds metadata to video content, enhancing its searchability. This AI-driven approach helps make content findable and accessible, unlocking it for future generations.\n\nOur AI metadata pipeline has a microservice-based architecture capable of processing large datasets while keeping processing costs low. To date, we have processed more than 150,000 hours of video material. Our facial recognition pipeline combines several open-source models for face detection (YuNet, Mediapipe) and face recognition (MagFace). For speech-to-text, we use SpeechMatics, a high-quality, multilanguage SaaS speech engine. For entity recognition and linking on the transcripts, we utilize TextRazor, a multilingual SaaS engine.\n\nWe will demonstrate the power of our pipeline by processing material from the Video Person-Clustering Dataset and the YouCook2 Dataset. This demonstration will apply facial recognition, speech-to-text, entity recognition, and entity linking models, to create AI-generated metadata and illustrate the improved searchability. While whisking in new insights and sprinkling some Generative AI (GenAI) on top, we will enable content creation and transformation, baking up the future potential of our technology.\n\n## References:\n- Video Person-Clustering Dataset: https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/Video_Person_Clustering/\n- YouCook2 Dataset: http://youcook2.eecs.umich.edu/download\n- YuNet: Wu et al.
