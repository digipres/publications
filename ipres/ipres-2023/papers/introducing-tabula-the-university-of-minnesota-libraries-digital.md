abstract: The University of Minnesota Libraries journey with preserving digital materials
  has been a long one.  After completing an RFP for a preservation system, and then
  testing that system for multiple years, we decided it was not the system for us.
  Over 2021 and 2022, we took our requirements along with the lessons we learned from
  testing, and began to design our own preservation system.  Our main goal with this
  new system is to preserve the unique materials of the Libraries and to be able to
  provide access to staff that need copies of preservation files for publication or
  research requests.  This poster highlights the development process of Tabula, our
  digital preservation system.
