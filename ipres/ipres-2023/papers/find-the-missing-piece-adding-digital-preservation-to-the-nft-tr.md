abstract: The NFT (Non-fungible token) market is experiencing explosive growth. While
  artists, collectors, and crypto enthusiasts are jumping into this ecosystem, traditional
  collectors have found it more challenging to evaluate asset value in this NFT market
  than in the established collectible market. This paper navigates the reason for
  this problem by examining the design of NFT using ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards,
  then illustrates that NFT’s infrastructure makes its evaluation more challenging
  based on its unstable or lacking connection to the underlying digital assets, which
  makes the evaluation of NFT inconsistent. This paper will propose a revised business
  model with a workflow to add digital preservation to the NFT trading ecosystem.  The
  paper suggests adding digital preservation clients to the Ethereum blockchain and
  building communication with the back-end digital preservation system to guarantee
  the stability of NFT’s digital assets. In the end, this paper will discuss the benefits
  of the new business model and workflow, with potential future challenges and opportunities
  to the revised NFT market.
