abstract: Email is one of the most ubiquitous forms of communication in both personal
  and professional contexts. The EA-PDF (Email Archiving with PDF) project is developing
  a PDF specification (PDF/mail) for email archiving, as well as an open-source tool
  to convert emails to the new PDF format. By creating a new specification defining
  common understandings for archiving email, the project aims for PDF/mail to lower
  barriers to effective email preservation that meets the needs of the archive and
  digital preservation community.  This includes building a community to support the
  project, developing the PDF specification itself, and creating a proof-of-concept
  tool to convert emails to PDF. With an open-source tool available for converting
  emails, archivists and other professionalsâ€”particularly those working in context
  where they do not have access to technologies supporting email preservation--will
  have a straightforward and cost-effective way of preserving emails for posterity,
  complementing other preservation methods and tools.
