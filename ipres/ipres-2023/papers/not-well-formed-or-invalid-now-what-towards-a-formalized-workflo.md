abstract: File format validation â€“ we all use it and we all run into problems when
  files do not validate. Though a core process within digital preservation practice,
  little progress has been made in shared documentation and discussion of processes
  used to treat file format validation errors. This paper aims to close that gap.
  A basic workflow for handling validation errors is proposed and visualized, and
  in a second step tested against two TIFF and two PDF validation errors of varying
  severity. Observations made are fed back into the workflow diagram. The outcome
  shall provide a first step towards shared digital preservation practice in the currently
  largely neglected field of method formalization for file format validation error
  treatment.
