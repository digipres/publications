abstract: Since 2008, the End of Term Web Archive has been gathering snapshots of
  the federal web, consisting of the publicly accessible .gov and .mil websites. In
  2022, the End of Term team began to package these crawls into a public dataset which
  they released as part of the Amazon Open Data Partnership program. In total, over
  460TB of WARC data was moved from local repositories at the Internet Archive and
  the University of North Texas Libraries. From the original WARC content, derivative
  datasets were created that address common use cases for web archives. These derivatives
  include WAT, WET, CDX and a format called a WARC Metadata Sidecar. This WARC Metadata
  Sidecar includes content-based characterizations of ﬁles held in the archive, including
  character set, language, ﬁle format identiﬁer, and soft 404 detection. This paper
  describes the decisions made in the creation of these derivatives, the technologies
  used, and introduces the WARC Metadata Sidecar, which presents a useful approach
  for creating and storing auxiliary metadata for web archives.
