abstract: 'The world of digital preservation and archiving has drawn heavily on the
  thinking of our analogue predecessors. When it comes to selecting materials, we
  are familiar with the idea of appraisal: “the process of determining whether records
  and other materials have permanent (archival) value” [1]. Typically, the notion
  of “value” is then further refined into broad sub-genres, such as evidential, informational,
  intrinsic, contextual, and so forth [2]. At iPres 2022, a panel session and related
  poster examined the problem of “The Value of Catastrophic Data Loss” but the debate
  repeatedly returned to measuring this value purely in terms of economic costs. This
  paper unpicks the notion of value further, and offers some reflections on how these
  ideas might apply to digital materials and be predicated on the essential differences
  between analog and digital sources.'
