abstract: Over the last three years, The National Archives (UK) and the Digital Preservation
  Coalition have collaborated on the development of a growing body of training content
  under the banner of the “Novice to Know-How” learning pathway. The content has proved
  to be incredibly popular, opening the door to digital preservation training for
  individuals and organizations that previously had not been able or willing to engage
  with the topic. This paper will examine the projects motivations, outputs, impact,
  and future plans.
