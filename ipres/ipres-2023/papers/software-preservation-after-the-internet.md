abstract: Software preservation must consider knowledge management as a key challenge.
  We suggest a concep-tualization of software preservation approaches that are available
  at different stages of the software lifecycle and can support memory institutions
  to assess the current state of software items in their collection, the capabilities
  of their infrastructure, and completeness and applicability of knowledge that is
  required to successfully steward the collec-tion.
