abstract: In 2020, Adobe announced that they would end support for Adobe Flash Player.
  Initially, we (the preservation team at the National Archives of the Netherlands)
  assumed we had only a few or no Flash objects in our digital repository, but this
  assumption turned out to be incorrect. The discovery of Flash objects in our holding
  led to the start of a research project to answer several questions. Through a series
  of dedicated meetings, we formulated a strategy focused on preserving ongoing accessibility
  to our Flash objects through emulation. We were curious to find out if we had Flash
  objects, where they were located, and which solution would help us render these
  objects. This was done with the use of the three preservation functions (Watch,
  Action, and Planning). After locating the Flash objects, we were able to test potential
  solutions. The results were then applied to our situation at the National Archives.
  This led to the development of conclusions and several pieces of advice accompanying
  those.
