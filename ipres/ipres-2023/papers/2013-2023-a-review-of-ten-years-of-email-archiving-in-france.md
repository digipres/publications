abstract: 'Emails are an essential medium of communication. Their management is an
  organizational, security, legal and financial issue for all organizations.

  The interdepartmental digital archiving Vitam program, which develops a digital
  archives management system on behalf of the French government, could not help but
  wonder about the acquisition, preservation and access to the documents and data
  contained in email archives. In 2013, it carried out a proof of concept on email
  archiving, at a time when few archive services in France had embarked on the acquisition
  of this type of document.

  Ten years later, the French landscape in terms of digital recordkeeping has changed
  significantly. In practice, some archives have put in place strategies for archiving
  email and tools have been made available to assist in their effort.

  This article looks at the transition from theory to practice of a more operational
  acquisition of this type of archive in a French context.'
