abstract: Building sustainable quality assurance practices is a challenge for today's
  preservationists, who want to be sure that content preserved in web archives is
  not only the correct content, but in working order. This often means that archived
  web content should be replayed via Wayback rendering software in good fidelity when
  compared to the original website. The exponentially growing scale of web archives
  necessitates a multipronged approach to identify what is (and is not) being preserved,
  and where improvements can be made. This paper will explore actions that can take
  place iteratively throughout the web archiving life cycle, as part of a larger system
  of review where multiple individuals can contribute, including non-technical Library
  staff and subject matter experts. The processes described are part of a novel workflow
  in the Library of Congress Web Archiving Program.
