abstract: Long-term preservation of born-digital moving image content is similar to
  that of any other file-based content in many ways. However, large file sizes, specialized
  equipment and resources, significant processing storage needs, and the movement
  of large files are challenges to creating sustainable and scalable workflows. The
  Moving Image Section of the National Audio Visual Conservation Center at the Library
  of Congress is making great strides in the development of sustainable and scalable
  workflows through an understanding of the technical infrastructure, moving image
  file characteristics and requirements, and the adoption of automated workflows using
  a combination of open source software and hardware resources.
