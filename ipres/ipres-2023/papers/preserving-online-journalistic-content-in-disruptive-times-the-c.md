abstract: Journalistic content is a crucial part of history, yet its longevity always
  remains uncertain without proper curation and preservation. This is true in particular
  when it comes to journalistic content under authoritarian regime contexts, where
  freedom of the press and information freedom are usually in vain. The article explores
  the case of collection.news, a community initiative that crawled, disseminated and
  hosted the journalistic content of Apple Daily, a pro-democracy media outlet that
  was forcibly shut down by the authority in Hong Kong. By discussing the key events
  and tools used by collection.news initiative, the three distinctive features of
  it, namely exigency, decentralization, and anonymity, are highlighted. Finally,
  suggestions to the digital preservation field for supporting these community initiatives
  in authoritarian regimes will be given.
