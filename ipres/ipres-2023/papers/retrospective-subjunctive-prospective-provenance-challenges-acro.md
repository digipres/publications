abstract: 'This panel will explore provenance: as theory and practice; as a tool for
  sustainability; and as a space of shared struggle and challenge for digital preservations
  and those in fields ranging from archives to cluster computing. In digital preservation,
  provenance tells us where an object has come from, the myriad preservation actions
  we could take to care for it, and where we predict the object will need to go in
  future. This panel is intended for anyone who is interested in the world of provenance:
  defining it, understanding it, modeling it, addressing the vague dissatisfaction
  practitioners often have when researching and documenting it. Provenance is more
  about the journey than the destination: this panel aims to surface a variety of
  experiences with provenance and to facilitate discussion and a community of practice
  around the relationship between digital preservation and provenance.'
