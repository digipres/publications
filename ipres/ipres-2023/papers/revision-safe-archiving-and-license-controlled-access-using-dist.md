abstract: This paper describes an approach and a prototype system to make use of Distributed
  Ledger Technology or, more specifically, Blockchain, to build a trusted digital
  repository with a transparent and traceable change record for events related to
  the preservation or action of requesting or granting access to digital information
  objects. The approach focuses on a notary use case where the information stored
  in the blockchain serves as a proof of evidence regarding the existence and integrity
  of digital information objects.
