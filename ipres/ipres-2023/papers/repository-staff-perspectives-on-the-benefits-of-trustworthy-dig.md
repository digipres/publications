abstract: This paper reports on the results from a qualitative study that asks whether
  and how staff members from TRAC certified repositories find value in the audit and
  certification process. While some interviewees found certification valuable, others
  argued that the costs outweighed the benefits or expressed ambivalence towards certification.
  Findings indicate that TRAC certification offered both internal and external benefits,
  such as improved documentation, accountability, transparency, communication, and
  standards, but there were concerns about high costs, implementation problems, and
  lack of objective evaluation criteria.
