abstract: Within the Digital Preservation Community there are many references to policies
  on file formats, acceptable file formats, preservation policies and strategies,
  risk matrices, and action plans. All have the intention of defining and describing
  file formats and guiding decisions on which formats to preserve how, and when. My
  team and I originally created a File Format Action Plan, which was later migrated
  from OneNote to Confluence and then included more strategic plans for hundreds of
  file formats. This paper explores which key elements should be included in an effective
  file format strategy and the different ways such data can be used by people and
  systems. What works for one institution may not work for another, and the work created
  by a larger institution may benefit those with smaller resources.
