abstract: 'Directed by an Inuit-led and serving tribal organization, Aqqaluk Trust,
  in the frontline hub-community of Kotzebue, Alaska, the Rematriation Project: Restoring
  and Sharing Inuit Knowledges aims to create capacity for and access to digital archives
  related to Inuit cultural, tribal, and scientific knowledges and history to assist
  tribes and communities in developing localized, culturally appropriate approaches
  and solutions to their needs. In partnership with a team of scholars from Virginia
  Tech (itself led by an Iñupiaq scholar from Kotzebue)—the goal of this project is
  to empower Indigenous communities through the lens of Indigenous data and research
  sovereignty to collect, control, interpret, and benefit from data that originates
  from their communities. The Rematriation Project operates on a foundation of community-first,
  community-led decision making that emphasizes Indigenous Data Sovereignty practices.
  This paper outlines the goals and initiatives of the first phases of the project.'
