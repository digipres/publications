abstract: "The Digital Preservation Storage Criteria (“Criteria”) are designed to
  provide community guidance for organizations that either use or provide digital
  preservation storage. Currently on its fourth iteration, the Criteria have been
  mapped to relevant information security and digital preservation standards such
  as ISO 14721 (OAIS) and ISO 16363 (Audit and certification of trustworthy digital
  repositories). This standards mapping exercise has led to many changes in the Criteria.
  The authors propose a workshop to get feedback from participants on key elements
  of the draft fourth version of the Digital Preservation Storage Criteria (“Criteria”).
  \nThis workshop will provide participants with an introduction to the Criteria and
  then will lead the participants in group exercises designed to test the assumptions
  and work behind draft version 4 of the Criteria. The expected outcomes are a deeper
  understanding of considerations for digital preservation storage by the participants,
  and feedback to the Criteria working group on draft version 4 before it is published
  after the conference."
