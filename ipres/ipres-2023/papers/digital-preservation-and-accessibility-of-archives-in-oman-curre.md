abstract: Digital preservation significance is widely recognized and imperative for
  all institutions. It is a pressing concern for archival specialists who acknowledge
  its relevance and necessity in contemporary information management practices. The
  current paper aims to examine the present state of digital preservation and Accessibility
  of institutional archives in Oman and to ascertain the challenges and prospects
  in this domain. This research is conducted through a comprehensive analysis of the
  extant literature and semi-structured interviews with administrative personnel employed
  in both public and private institutions in Oman. Semi-structured interviews were
  conducted with ten professionals in governmental organizations, who were chosen
  based on their expertise and experience in the field, using purposive sampling.
  The findings showed that interviewees in Omani institutions value digital preservation
  for many reasons, such as compliance with Omani law on archives, improved organization
  and security, and ease of document access. However, all institutions have no unified
  application strategy for digital preservation. The findings revealed many challenges,
  including technological obsolescence, security risks, big data management, and human
  resource challenges.
