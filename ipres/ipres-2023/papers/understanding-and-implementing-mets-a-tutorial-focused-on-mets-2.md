abstract: This half day tutorial will provide participants with an introduction to
  the Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS) starting in METS version
  1 and the METS Primer [1], but focusing on METS version 2. It will give a basic
  overview of METS and explore different models of implementation. The METS schema
  is a standard for encoding descriptive, administrative, and structural metadata
  regarding objects within a digital library as well as digital archives, expressed
  using the XML schema language of the World Wide Web Consortium. It is maintained
  by the METS Editorial Board, and the METS Maintenance Activity is managed by the
  Library of Congress [2].
