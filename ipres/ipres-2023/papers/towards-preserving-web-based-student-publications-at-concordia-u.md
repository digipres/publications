abstract: Student-run papers, journals, and magazines that were previously published
  in print form are now almost exclusively hosted on digital publishing platforms.
  How will this shift impact the longevity of student scholarship and institutional
  memory? This paper will present an ongoing project that aims to archive web-based
  student publications at Concordia University. We will discuss the rationale behind
  the project, our initial objectives and scope, and the challenges that we have encountered
  so far. We will conclude with a discussion of future opportunities for outreach
  and other envisioned pathways for collaboration.
