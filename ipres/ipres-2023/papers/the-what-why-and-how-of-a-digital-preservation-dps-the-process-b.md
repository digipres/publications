abstract: Jisc are considering implementing a Dynamic Purchasing system for members
  to use when procuring a Digital Preservation System. This poster shows what a DPS
  is and the process we’re undergoing to decide if we will provide a DPS. In effect,
  how we’re building a robust business case to provide a DPS for our members.
