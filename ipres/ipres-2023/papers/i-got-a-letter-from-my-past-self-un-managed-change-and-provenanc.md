abstract: 'Significant properties (sigProps) research often focuses on the preservation
  targets. Yet research consistently shows that what is significant about an object
  is not necessarily inherent to objects. Simultaneously, sigProps research does not
  adequately attend to temporality. Time is built into the concept of sigProps: they
  are about what ideally should not change over time. This paper centers temporality
  in relation to sigProps to explore challenging case studies.'
