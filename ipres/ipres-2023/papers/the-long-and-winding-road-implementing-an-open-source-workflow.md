abstract: This paper will discuss the recent work of the abrdn archive to create and
  put in place a fully open-source workflow, the barriers faced, and what was learnt
  from the experience. abrdn plc, an Edinburgh based investment company, is the first
  financial institution to implement a fully open-source digital preservation workflow.
  The following text provides an analysis of the work undertaken by the archive thus
  far, and argues that the least important aspect of implementing an open-source workflow
  is the software. Our journey has definitely been a long and winding road with many
  wrong turns, misleading directions, and occasional problems with running out of
  fuel, but the outcome has been positive and archive colleagues are keen to find
  out where the road will lead them next.
