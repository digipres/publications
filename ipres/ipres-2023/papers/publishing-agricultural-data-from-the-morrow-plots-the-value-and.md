abstract: The Morrow Plots at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign are the
  longest-running continuous experimental agricultural fields in the Americas. At
  iPres 2022 we reported on work to curate, preserve, and visualize planting, treatment,
  and yield data collected from the plots' nearly 150-year history. This paper provides
  an update on these efforts over the past year and, with special emphasis on the
  dataâ€™s scientific and cultural value, discusses the importance of collaborative
  and interdisciplinary work within the Morrow Plots stakeholder community to publish
  the dataset, and identify necessary next steps.
