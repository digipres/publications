abstract: At a basic level, virtualization [1] is the use of a host computer or serverâ€™s
  resources to run other computing environments. There are many ways in which virtualized
  computing environments may be deployed and interacted with, including using software
  to virtualize additional desktops on a local computer (e.g., VirtualBox, Hyper-V
  Manager, or VMWare) or accessing virtual command line interfaces hosted by a server
  or computer cluster [2],[3], and emulating old video game systems on contemporary
  hardware [4]. In this paper we discuss a cross-institutional collaboration on using
  containerization and desktop virtualization in digital curation at academic special
  collections libraries.
