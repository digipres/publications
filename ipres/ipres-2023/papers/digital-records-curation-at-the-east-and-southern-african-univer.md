abstract: Most of the knowledge generated in academic institutions today is in digital
  form. Given that institutional repositories (IRs) across universities receive, preserve
  and make access to digital assets. The aim of this study is to assess the status
  of digital curation at Institutional repositories in selected Universities in Botswana
  and Kenya. The study takes a quantitative approach whereby data was collected through
  survey questionnaires administered amongst university IR staff in Botswana and Kenya.
  The data collected was analysed and presented with tables and figures. The Open
  Archival Information System (OAIS) Functional Model was used in this study as a
  lens to investigate the problem. The findings of the study show that public universities
  in Botswana and Kenya have established IRs that ingest digital records into their
  custody. Most resources ingested include thesis and publications by academic staff
  and students. These IRs store their digital records on local servers and other storages
  like CDs. This study found that the majority of the IRs both in Botswana and Kenya
  do not have digital records preservation plans. This study recommends the use of
  the OAIS model to preserve, manage and make access to digital records at East and
  Southern African public Universities Institutional Repositories.
