abstract: "The ARCHIVER Project has brought together customers, vendors, and infrastructure
  providers in an outstanding successful public-private collaborative project, which
  has also been recognized with the Award for Collaboration and Cooperation which
  celebrates significant collaboration across institutional, professional, sectoral
  and geographical boundaries at the Digital Preservation Awards 2022. \nThis paper
  will review, from the perspective of one of the project winners, the success story
  of the ARCHIVER Project, highlighting the benefits achieved by leveraging the commercial
  digital preservation solutions for scientific research data through a pre-commercial
  procurement process, where end users were able to directly influence the expected
  functionalities in the platform and how they are expected to operate."
