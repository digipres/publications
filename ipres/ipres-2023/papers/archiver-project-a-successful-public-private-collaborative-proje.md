abstract: This paper will review, from the perspective of one of the project winners,
  the success story of the ARCHIVER Project, highlighting the benefits achieved by
  leveraging the commercial digital preservation solutions for scientific research
  data through a pre-commercial procurement process, where end users were able to
  directly influence the expected functionalities in the platform and how they are
  expected to operate.
