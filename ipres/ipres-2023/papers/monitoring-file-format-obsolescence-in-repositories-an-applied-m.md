abstract: The Dutch Digital Heritage Network (DDHN) wants to improve the monitoring
  of file format obsolescence. The Preservation Watch group researched on how institutions
  can monitor the life cycle of file formats in their repositories and how the monitoring
  could be implemented on a broader scale. Monitoring file format life cycle implies
  there needs to be a way to measure format obsolescence or helps an institution to
  identify when a file format is getting obsolete. The applied research identified
  the needed information and used a known model to search for trends and is applied
  in widespread areas. The model was compared with a naive method to evaluate the
  more complex method. This approach was tested in different types of repositories
  and used different file formats to research the robustness of the approach. This
  paper will investigate the possibilities and shortcomings of this method and further
  research that is required.
