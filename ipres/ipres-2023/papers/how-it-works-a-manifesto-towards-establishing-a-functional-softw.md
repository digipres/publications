abstract: "This paper presents the decision making process involved in establishing
  a software collection at the Vienna Museum of Science and Technology. The museum's
  collecting activities have been limited to the collection of tangible heritage.
  The current collection strategy defines the functionality of a museum object solely
  as its own material manifestation. That is why the museum keeps its physical collection
  in a “powered-off” state to preserve its integrity and functionality for the future.
  \nTo integrate a functional software collection into this theoretical frame we are
  discussing applied terminology and have developed a manifesto to build on a solid
  theoretical foundation."
