abstract: This panel explores the possibilities and challenges of volumetric video
  capture for digital humanities research and pedagogy, particularly in terms of documenting
  and representing the stories of BIPOC Americans who have lived through historical
  eras of global conflict. The panel will focus on the panelistsâ€™ experiences working
  with volumetric video and their work on a multi-institutional National Endowment
  for the Humanities-funded project. Panelists will offer perspectives on the benefits
  of volumetric video and its preservation challenges.
