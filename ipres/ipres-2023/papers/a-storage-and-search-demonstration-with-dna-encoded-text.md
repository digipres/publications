abstract: DNA-based data storage (DDS) holds promise to deliver a paradigm shift for
  long-term, secure storage of data. To tap into this potential, methods must be developed
  to produce data-encoding DNA molecules with cost- and time-effective processes.  Combinatorial
  synthesis of DNA molecules from prefabricated fragments of DNA offers a solution
  to this challenge.  We are developing a DNA-based platform combining encoding algorithms,
  high-throughput synthesis, post-synthesis processing, sequencing, decoding algorithms,
  and DNA computing architectures into a unified system.  DNA datasets encoding images
  and literary works have been successfully created and translated back into conventional
  data files containing the entire original set of data or a targeted subset of data.  In
  this work, we demonstrate the ability to search for specific molecules encoding
  a specific word in a DNA dataset encoding the complete text of multiple literary
  works.
