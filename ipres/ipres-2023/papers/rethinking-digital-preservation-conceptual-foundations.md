abstract: In support of a multi-year initiative to revitalize its core digital preservation
  infrastructure, the Harvard Library is engaged in an open-ended exploration of an
  ideal system solution.  The individual components of that ideal cohere into abstract
  functional and informational reference models, which act as aspirational  benchmarks
  for requirements and subsequent procurement and deployment activities.  The models
  are  derived through the logical refinement of a small set of high-level axiomatic
  principles.  These reflect a conceptualization of digital preservation as an inherently
  communicative enterprise with an ultimate goal of complementing the persistence
  of authentic digital information objects with that of opportunities for legitimate
  information experiences.
