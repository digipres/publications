abstract: Emails are an essential medium of communication. Their management is an
  organizational, security, legal and financial issue for all organizations. The interdepartmental
  digital archiving Vitam program, which develops a digital archives management system
  on behalf of the French government, could not help but wonder about the acquisition,
  preservation and access to the documents and data contained in email archives. In
  2013, it carried out a proof of concept on email archiving, at a time when few archive
  services in France had embarked on the acquisition of this type of document. Ten
  years later, the French landscape in terms of digital recordkeeping has changed
  significantly. In practice, some archives have put in place strategies for archiving
  email and tools have been made available to assist in their effort. This article
  looks at the transition from theory to practice of a more operational acquisition
  of this type of archive in a French context.
