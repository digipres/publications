abstract: 'According to Gilman (1917), food problem is related to three questions:
  First, “how to produce the most food with the least cost in time, labor and money,”
  second, how to swiftly, efficiently and economically distribute it to consumers,
  and, third, how to prepare and serve healthy food, without spending too much money,
  time, and effort. Since then, considerable progress has been made in improving food
  supply and facilitating meal preparation. This paper looks at the importance of
  digitizing the indigenous farming methods that can be incorporated with the emerging
  trends in present agriculture playing a significant role in ensuring food security.
  This paper is submitted to iPRESS 2023 as a poster aimed at improving indigenous
  agricultural knowledge with a base for new capabilities in providing solutions matters
