abstract: Many preservation actions that we undertake on digital content are driven
  by the format of the content in question. Format information is often determined
  at the point of ingest and is not regularly updated as our knowledge of file formats
  improves over time. Periodically re-characterizing all content in a repository would
  ensure that we get more accurate identifications over time, but a more sustainable
  approach would be to only re-characterize content that was actually likely to have
  changed. Preservica’s new Automated Active Digital Preservation feature seeks to
  do exactly this, but even when considering only subsets of the data in our cloud
  systems, we are faced with significant challenges of scale. In this paper, we describe
  those challenges, the approach we have taken to implement the feature, and the testing
  we have performed to verify the viability of this approach.
