abstract: This paper describes the use of a modification of qualitative grounded theory
  to analyze in-situ preservation workflows involving emulation techniques. The goal
  of this in-process work is to identify and delineate common tasks across the emulation
  of different classes of software objects through a unique approach based in bottom-up
  qualitative observation.
