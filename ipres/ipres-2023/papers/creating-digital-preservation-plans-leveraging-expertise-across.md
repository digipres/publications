abstract: The creation of Digital Preservation Plans requires leveraging a wide range
  of archival expertise. Our panel will discuss each of the components we have identified
  for inclusion in our preservation plans, along with specific skills and knowledge
  we depend upon from different parts of our team. Learn how we use a standard framework
  and leverage the expertise and enthusiasm of our Appraisal, Transfer, Ingest, and
  Arrangement and Description teams to create thorough and functional Digital Preservation
  Plans. Session will include recommendations of how to apply our approach at your
  institution.
