abstract: This workshop functions as a meeting ground for PREMIS practitioners, researchers,
  and curious onlookers. As opposed to PREMIS tutorials, which focus on introducing
  the data model and data dictionary, the PREMIS Implementation Fair focuses on work
  currently undertaken by the Editorial Committee as well as on real-world implementations,
  projects and open questions that the digital preservation community has around preservation
  metadata.
