abstract: This half-day (3-hour) tutorial is a pragmatic introduction to the Archival
  Resource Key (ARK), a 22-year-old, non-paywalled identifier scheme that is widely
  used for persistent access to cultural and scientific information. By the end of
  the tutorial, attendees will know when this highly flexible scheme is appropriate
  to use and how to create ARKs for their respective memory organizations. No prior
  experience is required.
