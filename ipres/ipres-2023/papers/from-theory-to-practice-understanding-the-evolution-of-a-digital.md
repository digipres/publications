abstract: "Usually, the resulting digital preservation project is very different from
  its conception. \nThe theory defined before starting a digital preservation project
  serves as a guide for the beginning of the project, but must be flexible enough
  to be adapted throughout the implementation to fit the real needs of the organization.\nIn
  this panel, representatives of institutions from different GLAM-UR sectors from
  different countries will speak from their own experience about the evolution of
  a digital preservation project from its theoretical conception to its real practical
  implementation."
