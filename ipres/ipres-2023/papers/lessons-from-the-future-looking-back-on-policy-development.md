abstract: 'Policy is an important component of a successful digital preservation program.
  For example, CoreTrustSeal [1] suggests that a policy statement would be appropriate
  evidence to demonstrate that a repository has an explicit mission to provide access
  to and preserve digital objects, and the DPC’s Rapid Assessment Model [2] suggests
  that a digital preservation policy should be in place in order to reach the ‘Basic’
  level of the ‘Policy and Strategy’ section. While resources exist [3] to assist
  organizations in developing their first digital preservation policy, these formative
  strategic documents are intended to hold relevance beyond their initial publication.
  This panel session highlighted challenges and opportunities in the development and
  ongoing maintenance of digital preservation policies across three organizations:
  U.S. National Archives and Records Administration, National Library of Ireland,
  and National Library of New Zealand. Panelists reflected on learnings from different
  stages of the policy lifecycle, including initial development, initiating revisions,
  and re-engaging with dormant policy documents. These efforts are contextualized
  within broader policy education resources, including the DPC’s revised Digital Preservation
  Policy Toolkit [4].'
