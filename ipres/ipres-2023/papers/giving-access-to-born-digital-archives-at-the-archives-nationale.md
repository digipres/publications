abstract: 'Born-digital archives, managed in a repository, are accessible thanks to
  the delivery of Dissemination Information Packages (DIP). While the DIP is a machine-readable
  format, it is not easily intelligible for the end user. In practice, making DIP
  truly accessible appears like a riddle. To make it more human-readable, a DIP must
  undergo some processing outside the repository and be converted in a new form, which
  should be discussed. These operations call into question the integrity of the archives,
  which was ensured until their delivery by the system. How, then, can archivists
  keep data trustworthy? Following recent requests for access, the Archives nationales
  (France) have provided some answers that could be used as a basis for discussion
  to solve this OeDIPus riddle. Their experience was one of moving from theory to
  practice, leading to the creation of an in-house proof-of-concept (POC) and tool:
  OE-DIP (Objets et Empreintes de DIP, Objects and Checksums of DIP).'
