abstract: The University of Sydney Library hosts many historically significant digital
  collections. In 2021 and 2022, the Library undertook a project to ensure the accessibility
  of these collections, migrating them from ageing web servers to our current repository
  systems. This paper outlines the challenges involved in managing bespoke legacy
  collections at an institution in the early stages of building digital preservation
  capacity. We discuss the approaches taken to make use of existing systems, capabilities,
  and resourcing to rescue collections and prepare for future preservation actions.
