abstract: Qatar National Library has launched a research repository named Manara to
  address the need for curating, preserving, and enabling Open Access to Qatari research
  output. The repository aims to operate on a consortium-based service model that
  allows sharing the overall responsibility of curating and preserving a wide variety
  of research outputs between the Library and key partner institutions, thereby developing
  a sustainable ecosystem for research outputs in Qatar. The poster presents the work
  done to establish Manara, including the underlying technical and operational model.
