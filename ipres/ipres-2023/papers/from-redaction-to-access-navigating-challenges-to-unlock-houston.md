abstract: The Gulf Coast LGBT Radio and Television Digitization Project launched in
  2020 to digitize, preserve, describe, and make accessible thousands of hours of
  Houstonâ€™s LGBTQ broadcast history. The authors explain the significance of the programs
  selected for inclusion in the project and describe the steps taken to balance the
  goal of equitable access to unique materials created by and for a marginalized community,
  while maintaining adherence to copyright restrictions.
