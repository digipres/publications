abstract: This panel asks the question “how can collective action build global capacity
  for digital preservation?” Drawing on their own experiences participating in community-driven
  initiatives, panelists will describe and showcase how collective action efforts
  have created shared opportunities for advancing digital preservation goals.  Following
  this discussion, panelists will reflect on the individual challenges and opportunities
  they faced in participating in such work. The panel will conclude with suggested
  next steps that can move the field globally towards a shared articulation of digital
  preservation work in practice.
