abstract: 'Fedora 6.x is the newest, most modern version of the software, representing
  a significant change in the preservation standards and backend infrastructure from
  previous versions. This modernization of the software provides users a more robust
  preservation platform, while giving the community back the data transparency they
  appreciated from Fedora 3. This workshop will provide participants with the ability
  to work directly with the newest version of Fedora through hands-on exercises as
  well as learning about the Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) and it’s role in digital
  preservation within a Fedora ecosystem. We will complete a sample migration using
  the Migration Toolkit, a series of instructional modules created from an IMLS grant-funded
  project, and gain experience working with the migration utility and validator tools.
  Lastly we will explore several community-developed integrations that allow for additional
  functionality and visibility into the contents within a Fedora repository.

  This workshop is intended to provide participants an opportunity to work directly
  with the software, understand it’s preservation features and become familiar with
  the recently developed tools for migrating from Fedora 3.x to 6.x.'
