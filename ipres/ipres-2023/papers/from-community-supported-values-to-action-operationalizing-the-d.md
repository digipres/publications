abstract: Operating from a foundation of shared values, the community-supported digital
  preservation services represented in the Digital Preservation Services Collaborative
  (DPSC) empower stewards of digital content to make informed decisions by offering
  transparency and accountability. These values have become increasingly important
  as resources for digital preservation fail to meet the needs of organizations, forcing
  many mission-critical digital preservation activities to be outsourced to commercial
  providers. In the DPSC Planning Project, this group of mission-aligned service providers
  are working to establish closer and more intentional collaboration between their
  organizations, in order to guarantee the continued availability of services that
  prioritize transparency and accountability to the cultural heritage organizations
  they serve. In this interactive panel, partners from the DPSC Planning Project will
  discuss the importance of the shared values for digital preservation good practice,
  how they have enacted these values within their organizations, and other project
  findings.
