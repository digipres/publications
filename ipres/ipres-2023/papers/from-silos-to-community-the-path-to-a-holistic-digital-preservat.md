abstract: While New York University Libraries has a long history of and commitment
  to digital collecting and preservation efforts, the institution did not have any
  policies governing the services and activities of digital preservation prior to
  2022. This paper details the creation of a holistic digital preservation policy
  statement, with contributors from across ten functional units at NYU Libraries.
  The policy was grounded in the Libraries’ mission and values–including  deep commitments
  to inclusion, diversity, belonging, equity, and accessibility–and drew on themes
  crafted by all members of the group to ensure their work was represented in the
  statement. The success of the policy group was rooted in its intentional formation
  and processes that acknowledged the distributed nature of digital preservation and
  emphasized the creation of a community of practice. Further, it laid the foundation
  for a more complete suite of preservation policies and forward-looking conversations
  about how to enact ethical and sustainable stewardship in digital collecting, access,
  and preservation practices.
