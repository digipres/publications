abstract: The Community Archive Scheme is a bottom-up method of community engagement
  that the Digital Repository of Ireland (DRI) uses to work directly with no or low-income
  groups with digital material to preserve. The DRI's usual depositors are academic,
  cultural heritage, or public organisations and libraries with a long history of
  archiving who select material from their own collections for preservation. Through
  the Community Archive Scheme, we work in a hands-on way to provide digital preservation
  to a wider range of groups that fall outside of this sphere. The scheme celebrates
  its fifth anniversary in 2023 and during this period DRI has worked with nine voluntary
  groups to help preserve material on a variety of topics including the experience
  of asylum seekers in Ireland, maternal health, built heritage, LGBT rights and activism
  in Ireland. The types of material that we are working to preserve through this scheme
  vary from photographs of artists' works such as quilts, audio-visual material such
  as community documentaries, and documentaries produced for digital radio and social
  media. This paper will discuss how the scheme evolved, how these organisations have
  strengthened DRI as an organisation as well as making our community and collections
  more equitable and diverse, challenges we have encountered, some of the solutions
  we have developed, where our successes have come from and some of the future developments
  we are exploring so that we can continue to work with these groups.
