abstract: Environmental sustainability is becoming an important factor in digital
  preservation. We have calculated the carbon footprint of our Finnish national digital
  preservation services, which we provide for cultural heritage and research sectors.
  We concentrate on the carbon footprint of manufacturing hardware and shipping the
  equipment to data centers, and the carbon footprint of the hardware service life
  and employees related to the services. Using data provided to us by the hardware
  manufacturers and other sources, we show that the majority of the emissions come
  from manufacturing and shipping of hardware, whereas the emissions created during
  the service life has a smaller role. As a whole, the annual carbon footprint of
  the services is smaller than the annual carbon footprint of three average Finns.
