abstract: Mobile devices have revolutionized computing and democratized access to
  it. The applications we use on our mobile devices play a critical role in shaping
  our online experiences, our culture, our politics, and our access to information.
  Mobile applications are also widely used for data gathering and asset management
  in many domains from scientific research to infrastructure maintenance. With such
  a wide-reaching impact it is critical that the preservation community is able to
  maintain access to mobile applications for future generations. In this short paper
  we outline progress in using the Emulation as a Service Infrastructure (EaaSI) platform
  to run obsolete versions of the Android operating system in virtualization and emulation
  in order to maintain access to mobile applications. We also detail the current limitations
  of virtualizing and emulating mobile devices and provide a list of future challenges
  to address as we move forwards with ensuring long-term access to this essential
  part of our history.
