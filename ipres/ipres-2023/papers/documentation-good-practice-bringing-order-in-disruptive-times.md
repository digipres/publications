abstract: In times of disruption we need to do the less interesting parts of our job
  better than ever. Documentation falls into this category - a sometimes neglected
  task that is often sidelined in favor of new and exciting innovations or even just
  the constant pressure of other routine tasks. It is easy to forget to create documentation
  or to let existing documents stagnate and become out-of-date. And yet, in the event
  of a disaster, it may be the very first thing we will turn to, to help to bring
  order to the chaos. When faced with lockdown as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic
  in early 2020, there is some evidence that digital preservation practitioners turned
  to maintenance tasks like documentation when working from home [1]. Digital preservation
  documentation is undoubtedly important to us in the digital preservation community
  but where is the good practice guidance that tells us what to document, when, where
  and how? This paper describes work at the Digital Preservation Coalition to gather
  together community experiences to create a new good practice guide on digital preservation
  documentation.
