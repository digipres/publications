abstract: This poster presents one of the final outputs produced from a collaborative
  project between the Digital Preservation Coalition and the Nuclear Decommissioning
  Authority in the UK, “Digital preservation requirements for procuring IT systems”.
  This addition to the Digital Preservation Coalition’s Procurement Toolkit proposes
  the requirements that should be considered when procuring an IT system (for example
  an EDRMS, DAMS, or GIS) that may ultimately contain at least some records or digital
  content that needs to be retained beyond the life of the system.
