abstract: It is not unusual to find at-risk obsolete carriers in archival collections,
  but these 3½ inch ADFS-formatted floppy disks hold original digital artworks from
  the late career of a pioneering Australian multimedia artist. The graphics files,
  created on an Acorn Archimedes in the late 80s and early 90s, had not been seen
  for more than 25 years, and the difficult process of preserving and providing access
  to these artworks, and their associated software, highlights the fragility of the
  material from this era. The case study presented here discusses how the State Library
  of South Australia combined open-source and community software to automate the extraction
  and migration of obsolete content from these disks while capturing filesystem and
  other metadata—and discovered that emulation is not always the simplest solution.
