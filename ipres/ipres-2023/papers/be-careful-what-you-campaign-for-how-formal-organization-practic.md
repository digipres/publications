abstract: Digital preservationists often struggle using their expert knowledge to
  create change within their own organization. Because of this, they might need to
  resort to campaigning for decision-making authority. Why is this? Memory institutions
  are used to adhering to standards and rules. Rules and regulations are beneficial
  for stability and trustworthiness. But too much focus on rules may create organizational
  rigidity which negatively impacts adaptability. Adaptability is a major goal for
  preservation so how could we create more room for this? An important part of adaptability
  is organizational learning. In order to facilitate learning we must understand which
  aspects of organizational practice negatively affect it. For example, avoiding discussion
  of mistakes is an important barrier to learning. If an organization prioritizes
  learning this can have a positive impact on the motivation of employees. Practitioners
  may feel more in control when they understand how to use theories of organizational
  learning to further implementation of preservation principles. More room for learning
  within the organization might also benefit the field of preservation itself through
  enhanced knowledge of what works and what doesn't.
