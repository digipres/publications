abstract: This poster presents the preliminary findings of a project that analyzes
  archival materials about the 1885 Rock Springs Massacre to understand archival silences
  around the experiences of Chinese people in the United States. We observed that
  metadata contributes to the exclusion of Chinese people through absent categories,
  overly narrow subject descriptions, and an emphasis on foreignness and otherness.
  Future work will identify points of intervention in digital preservation to address
  these issues.
