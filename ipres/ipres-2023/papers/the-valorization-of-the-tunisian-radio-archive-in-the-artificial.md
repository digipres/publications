abstract: 'Radio Elyssa''s sound archives face challenges in the post-revolution Tunisian
  context: preserving a large volume of digital content with limited resources while
  preserving Tunisia''s cultural heritage. The Digital Cooperation Association Tunisia
  and Radio Elyssa are collaborating to test the potential of Artificial Intelligence
  tools to automate archival tasks. Before any automation, it is necessary to understand
  the regulatory procedures for digital archiving: identifying, classifying, migrating,
  and storing data according to best practices. Long-term preservation faces challenges
  due to limited resources and increasing digitization. The combination of human expertise
  and AI will enable Radio Elyssa to use AI responsibly to fulfill its mission.'
