abstract: As part of a research project, a small team of preservation experts has
  been embedded within publisher workflows to analyze the challenges associated with
  preserving complex scholarly publications. As the project reaches the midway point,
  patterns are emerging regarding preservation-friendly practices that could potentially
  be incorporated into production processes and platforms to support preservation
  at scale. One common threat to the preservability of the analyzed publications is
  the inclusion of web pages that are hosted by a third party (e.g., YouTube videos,
  ArcGIS visualizations) within the text using iframes. The team is exploring methods
  to improve preservability in such instances while considering the constraints of
  the project partners and the requirement that preservation services can scale their
  processes across numerous publications.
