abstract: We introduce a technique for Ô¨Ånding multilingual translations for lists
  of words using technologies of the Semantic Web. We present four subsets of data
  from Wikidata and Wikipedia as sources of multilingual labels. Our sample dataset
  consists of seven terms related to digital preservation. We compare the number of
  labels we can source for these terms from other human languages via SPARQL queries
  using the Wikidata Query Service. After discussing the composition of each subset,
  we detail their advantages and disadvantages. Providing multilingual la- bels as
  additional access points for resources such as on- tologies, vocabularies and user
  interfaces for applications increases the relevance of these resources to a larger
  per- centage of the global population. Increasing multilingual access promotes inclusion
  for a broader range of people, which leads to greater diversity in the digital preservation
  community.
