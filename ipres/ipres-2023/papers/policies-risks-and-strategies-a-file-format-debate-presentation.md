abstract: The digital preservation community has been developing approaches to preserving
  the meaning of digital content for a number of decades. But questions still remain
  as to the most accurate, practical, timely and cost effective way of keeping our
  data usable. Collating and presenting file format policies from several organizations
  triggered a lively panel discussion in early 2023. This panel session will build
  on the success and popularity of that debate by bringing in new voices and topics
  raised by the audience. This subject is a critical one to understand if we are to
  be successful in preserving our data for future generations.
