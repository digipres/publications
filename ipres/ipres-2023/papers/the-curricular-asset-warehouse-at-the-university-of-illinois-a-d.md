abstract: 'What happens to the devices that host digital objects – hard drives, monitors,
  computer peripherals, storage media – when it is time to upgrade digital preservation
  environments and workflows? Each step of the production and stewardship of digital
  objects requires devices and software that have short life cycles and multiple drivers
  of ever faster obsolescence. These devices flow out of digital repositories and
  contribute to the fastest growing waste stream of the 21st century: electronic waste
  or “e-waste.“ The Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning (CITL) at the University
  of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is currently working with the head of the university’s
  Sustainable Design program to perform a case study of the sustainable management
  of its large volumes of digital video and image content production and preservation,
  within an analysis of its institutional purchasing and waste management paradigms.
  The purpose of this analysis is to determine how device obsolescence at CITL can
  be mitigated to avoid future costs and to minimize the department’s contribution
  to the global e-waste problem.'
