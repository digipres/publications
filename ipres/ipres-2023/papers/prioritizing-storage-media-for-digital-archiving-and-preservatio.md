abstract: This paper summarizes our efforts to-date at Archives & Special Collections,
  University of Glasgow, to develop a methodology and tool for prioritizing archival
  processing of digital collections stored in physical storage media. We present the
  sources and process we used to develop the methodology, and outline the functionality
  of a prototypical tool to generate prioritization scores.
