abstract: We proposed a decentralized version tracking system using the existing primitives
  of IPFS and IPNS. While our description talks primarily about archived web pages,
  we proposed the concept of IPMT and namespacing so that it can be used in other
  applications that require versioning, such as a wiki or a collaborative code tracking
  system. Our proposed system does not rely on any centralized server for archiving
  or replay of the content. The system continues to allow aggregators to play their
  role from which both large and small archives can benefit and flourish.
