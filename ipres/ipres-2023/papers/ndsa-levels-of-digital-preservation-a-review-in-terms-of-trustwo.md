abstract: Records created in organizations that have archival value should be preserved
  for a long time, and to achieve this, digital preservation techniques are used.
  These techniques also contribute to the preservation of the trustworthiness of the
  records. In order to assess the situation of organizations in the implementation
  of their digital preservation activities, there is a need for an analysis tool.
  Many models have been prepared to meet this need. One is the Levels of Preservation
  (LoP) developed by the National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA). The LoP provides
  guidance to organizations in their digital preservation activities. Therefore, it
  is thought that the LoP can be associated with trustworthiness which aims at long-term
  preservation of the records. This study examines the levels of digital preservation
  specified in the LoP in terms of the trustworthiness of digital records. As a result
  of this research, the goal is to provide the basis for a methodology for organizations
  wishing to assess their level of digital preservation and to align their digital
  preservation capabilities with trustworthiness. This study used document analysis
  as a qualitative research design. Both field observations and research show that
  organizations are not sufficiently aware of the level of digital preservation and
  trustworthiness. Then, the question of the study is “how the levels that are specified
  in the LoP can be associated with the trustworthiness”. As a result of the study,
  it has been observed that the levels of digital preservation specified in the LoP
  can be used in the analysis of the trustworthiness of the records. It is expected
  that this study will raise awareness in the organizations to do a better job of
  preserving the records that have archival value.
