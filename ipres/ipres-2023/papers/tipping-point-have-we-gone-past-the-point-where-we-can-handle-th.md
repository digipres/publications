abstract: The world today is faced with an insurmountable problem. There is too much
  digital “stuff” in existence for us to even handle in any sort of meaningful way,
  let alone curate and preserve. We have reached (or perhaps even gone beyond) the
  data processing tipping point. There is an enormous amount of data already in existence
  and unimaginably more being generated every day. This panel proposal (and accompanying
  poster) is intended to explore this doomsday data scenario with a group of experts
  in the field of Digital Preservation and related disciplines with a view to deciding
  if it is true and what can be done about it.
