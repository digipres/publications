abstract: Software is a very complex product, offering an endless number of different
  states and appearances. To foster academic discussion about software-based cultural
  and scientific phenomena like computer games, digital art, or scientific computational
  models, it is necessary to be able to reference specific moments of running software.
  In this article, we discuss the possibilities to “freeze” software while being executed
  and describe constraints for the long-term preservation of these snapshots.
