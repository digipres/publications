abstract: How do we apply the lessons of ongoing evaluations of digital preservation
  sustainability within single institutions to the products and services on which
  this sector increasingly depends? The speakers will look at this key question from
  different viewpoints to pool best practice and explore the issues to ensure the
  community can expect more durable systems however they are delivered.
