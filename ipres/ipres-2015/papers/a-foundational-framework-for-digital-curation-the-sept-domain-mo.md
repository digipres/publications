abstract: 'Digital curation is a complex of actors, policies, practices, and technologies
  enabling successful consumer engagement with authentic content of interest across
  space and time. While digital

  curation is a rapidly maturing field, it still lacks a convincing unified theoretical
  foundation. A recent internal evaluation by the University of California Curation
  Center (UC3) of its programmatic activities led quickly to seemingly simple, yet
  deceptively difficult-to-answer questions. Too many fundamental terms of curation
  practice remain overloaded and under-formalized, perhaps none more so than “digital
  object.” To address these concerns, UC3 is developing a new model for conceptualizing
  the curation domain. While drawing freely from many significant prior efforts, the
  UC3 Sept model also assumes that digital curation is an inherently semiotic activity.  Consequently,
  the model considers curated content with respect to six characteristic dimensions:  semantics,
  syntactics, empirics, pragmatics, diplomatics, and dynamics, which refer respectively
  to content’s underlying abstract meaning or emotional affect, symbolic encoding
  structures, physical representations, realizing behaviors, evidential authenticity
  and reliability, and evolution through time.  Correspondingly, the model defines
  an object typology of increasing consumer utility and value: blobs, artifacts, exemplars,
  products, assets, records, and heirlooms, which are respectively existential, intentional,
  purposeful, interpretable, useful, trustworthy, and resilient digital objects. Content
  engagement is modeled in terms of creator, owner, curator, and consumer roles acting
  within a continuum of concerns for catalyzing, organizing, and pluralizing curated
  content. Content policy and strategy are modeled in terms of seven high-level imperatives:
  predilect, collect, protect, introspect, project, connect, and reflect. A consistent,
  comprehensive, and conceptually parsimonious domain model is important for planning,
  performing, and evaluating programmatic activities in a rigorous and systematic
  rather than ad hoc or idiosyncratic manner. The UC3 Sept model can be used to make
  precise yet concise statements regarding curation intentions, activities, and results.'
