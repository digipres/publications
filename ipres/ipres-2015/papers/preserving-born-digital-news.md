abstract: The news industry has quickly adopted networked digital technologies to
  create and distribute their content across all media types and in an ever-increasing
  number of formats. These technologies have also enabled individuals to capture and
  share information, news, and opinion on contemporary and community events. These
  changes contribute to a dynamic news ecosystem, upending traditional publishing
  models that media companies, libraries, archives and memory institutions have depended
  on to save the news. In this panel, the challenges and opportunities of preserving
  born-digital news content will be presented and discussed. A preliminary environmental
  scan of the state of digital news preservation will be shared. Perspectives and
  tactics from the “front-line” of news creation will be covered in addition to establishing
  special collections to capture and preserve web sites that cover news events. Efforts
  to establish relationships with the creators of content management systems (CMS)
  that drive the back end of modern media publishing networks will also be presented,
  as will tools that have been developed to capture social media and other content
  from the web that contributes to the present day news ecosystem.
