abstract: 'This paper outlines an approach for developing tools and services that
  support automated generation, management, evolution and execution of data management
  plans (DMPs)

  by generating rules derived from the DMPs which can be applied to the data to be
  archived. The approach is based on existing models and tools that were developed
  in successive research projects SHAMAN, APARSEN, and SCIDIP-ES.  The models include
  the Curation Lifecycle Model from the

  DCC, the OAIS Information Model and the Extended Information Model to support processes,
  domains, and

  organizations. An approach for deriving rules from policies is outlined to support
  using iRODS. OAIS and Context

  Information related to a data object is supported in a serialization using the OAI-ORE
  format.'
