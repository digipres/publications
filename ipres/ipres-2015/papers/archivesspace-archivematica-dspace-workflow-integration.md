abstract: In recent years, ArchivesSpace and Archivematica have emerged as two of
  the most exciting open source platforms for working with digital archives. The former
  manages accessions and collections and provides a framework for entering descriptive,
  administrative, rights, and other metadata. The latter ingests digital content and
  prepares information packages for long-term preservation and access. In April 2014,
  the Bentley Historical Library received a $355,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon
  Foundation to partner with the University of Michigan Library on the integration
  of these two systems in an end-to-end workflow that will include the automated deposit
  of content into a DSpace repository. This poster will introduce the “ArchivesSpace-Archivematica-DSpace
  Workflow Integration” project and its goals, strategies, and development roadmap.
