abstract: Effectively preserving access to digital content over time is dependent
  on availability of an appropriate IT infrastructure including access to appropriate
  rendering software and its requisite operating systems and hardware. The complexity
  of this task increases over time and with the size and heterogeneity of digital
  collections. Automating notifications on file format endangerment and decision recommendations
  can greatly improve preservation planning processes. This paper presents work in
  progress that contributes to the design and testing of an automated file format
  endangerment notification and recommendation system. This systemâ€™s design is based
  on concepts explored in previous research, but it presents the novel application
  of statistically generated similarity profiles and machine-generated recommendations
  based on human expert input.
