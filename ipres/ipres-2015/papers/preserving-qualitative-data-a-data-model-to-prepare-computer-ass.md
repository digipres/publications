abstract: A rapid change in technology has a great impact on the long-term access
  to digital content. This makes preservation of a digital content a challenging task
  due to the content’s inherent dependency on a specific hardware/software platform.
  Changes in the technology without backward compatibility can lead to a content that
  can’t be viewed and qualitative data is no exception. Normalization is a commonly
  used strategy to keep content prepared for long-term preservation. However, tools
  are not always available to perform normalization on complex file formats such as
  qualitative data analysis software files. In this work, we are proposing a data
  model to normalize computer assisted qualitative data analysis software files to
  support long term access.
