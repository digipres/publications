abstract: 'Archiving web content is bound to produce datasets with duplication, either
  across time or across location. The Bibliotheca Alexandrina (BA) has a web archive
  legacy spanning a period of 10 years and is continuing to expand the collection.
  Initial assessment of this very large store of data was conducted. Given a high
  enough rate of duplication, deduplication would lead to sizable savings in storage
  requirements. The BA worked through the International Internet Preservation Consortium
  (IIPC) to compile best practices for recording duplicates in ISO 28500, the WARC
  File Format. To deduplicate legacy web archives “after the fact,” the BA is implementing
  the WARCrefs deduplication tools.  Following implementation and testing, the BA
  plans to put the tools to use to deduplicate its one petabyte of archived

  web content.'
