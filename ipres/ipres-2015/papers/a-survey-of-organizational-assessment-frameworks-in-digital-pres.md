abstract: 'As the field of digital preservation continues to mature, there is an increasing
  need to systematically assess an organization''s abilities to achieve its digital
  preservation goals. A

  wide variety of assessment tools exist for this purpose. These range from light-weight
  checklists to resource-intensive certification processes. Conducted as part of the
  BenchmarkDP

  project, this paper presents a survey of these tools that elucidates available options
  for practitioners and opportunities for further research.'
