abstract: 'To develop a comprehensive digital preservation program for maintaining
  long-term access to the Libraries’ digital assets and align our practices with national
  standards and guidelines, the

  University of Houston (UH) Libraries formed the Digital Preservation Task Force
  (DPTF) to assess previous digital

  preservation practices and make recommendations on future efforts. This paper outlines
  the methodology used, including the task force’s use of existing models and evaluation
  criteria, to

  successfully generate new policies and select Archivematica as our system to process
  and preserve our digital assets. It concludes with recommended strategies for the
  implementation of the

  policies and preservation operations.'
