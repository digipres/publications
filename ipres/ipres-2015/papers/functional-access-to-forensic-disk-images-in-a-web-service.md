abstract: 'We describe a hybrid approach for access to digital objects contained within
  forensic disk images extracted from physical media. This approach includes the use
  of emulation-as-a-service (EaaS) to provide web-accessible virtual environments

  for materials that may not render or execute accurately on modern hardware and software,
  and the use of

  digital forensics software libraries to produce web-accessible file system views
  to support single-file access and provide visualizations of the file system.'
