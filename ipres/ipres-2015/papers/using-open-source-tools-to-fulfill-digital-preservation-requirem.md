abstract: This workshop offers a space to talk about open-source software for digital
  preservation, and the particular challenges of developing systems and integrating
  them into local environments and workflows. Topics will include current efforts
  and grant-funded initiatives to integrate different open source archival software
  tools; the development of workflows involving multiple open source tools for digital
  preservation, forensics, discovery and access; and the identification of gaps which
  may need filled by these or other tools.
