abstract: 'Geospatial data are widely used by many institutions, governments, and
  corporations; given the diversity of organizations concerned with geospatial data,
  preserving and curating these important digital files presents unique challenges
  to the preservation community. In the University Libraries at Virginia Tech a small
  project team is working to use a local implementation of GeoBlacklight to build
  a flexible geospatial data portal that addresses the needs of diverse stakeholders
  on campus, including those outside the context of academic research. This poster
  will present the results of an initial geospatial data assessment, the issues and
  concerns of each stakeholder on campus, and how the GeoBlacklight implementation
  addresses both the challenges posed by the stakeholders and by the complexity of
  geospatial data itself.


  The Data Curation Unit in Newman Library at Virginia Tech is creating opportunities
  for geospatial discovery and preservation through collaboration with University
  Facilities and University IT. Libraries have long been known for institutional repositories
  that lack storage capacity and have outdated features. Through collaborative efforts
  with University Facilities and University IT the library has started implementation
  of an instance of GeoBlacklight to resolve these issues for our geospatial data
  users. The Facilities group has provided a variety of dataset use cases along with
  metadata schema input. IT has been responsible for setting up server space which
  allows for deposits of more than two gigabytes. The library has been responsible
  for the development of the interface. With this team we aim to provide a secure
  environment that incorporates the needs of non-academic patrons alongside a more
  traditional data repository, making it easier for campus users to deposit and extract
  data, and store larger sets of data than has previously been possible. This poster
  will present the results of our initial geospatial data assessment, the obstacles
  posed by working with numerous university stakeholders, and what we believe to be
  a sound solution for geospatial data discovery and preservation of both academic
  and non-academic geospatial data at Virginia Tech.


  Geospatial data generated for practical use (not specifically for research) became
  of interest once we began partnering with our University Facilities and University
  IT groups. We found that these campus departments frequently produce geospatial
  data that is often of interest to research groups across campus. In addition, there
  are several groups on campus that collect historical state government data containing
  geospatial components. Beginning with the acknowledgement that all data should be
  discoverable, we developed workflows that enable our GeoBlacklight instance to treat
  research and non-research data the same. Essentially we are creating a single discovery
  platform for all geospatial information acquired and created by Virginia Tech.


  We also found significant benefit in the collaboration with University IT, including
  access to greater storage space and stricter backup protocols. This partnership
  was developed on the premise that the library would help curate and make discoverable
  all geospatial data in use at Virginia Tech, as long as they University IT was responsible
  for maintaining server space and managing the backup processes for the datasets
  in their care. This allowed us to have experts focus on the storage and management
  of geospatial data allowing library staff to focus on collection and curation of
  the data.


  In essence, the GeoBlacklight project has become a means for better aligning the
  library as the central location for finding and accessing geospatial data at Virginia
  Tech, and has also allowed us to leverage campus partners to better optimize our
  ability to serve the discovery and preservation needs of the Virginia Tech community.'
