abstract: Developing, deploying and maintaining open source software is increasingly
  a core part of the core operations of cultural heritage organizations. From preservation
  infrastructure, to tools for acquiring digital and digitized content, to platforms
  that provide access, enhance content, and enable various modes for users to engage
  with and make use of content, much of the core work of libraries, archives and museums
  is entangled with software. As a result, cultural heritage organizations of all
  sizes are increasingly involved in roles as open source software creators, contributors,
  maintainers, and adopters. Participants in this workshop shared their respective
  perspectives on institutional roles in this emerging open source ecosystem. Through
  discussion, participants created drafts of a checklist for establishing FOSS projects,
  documentation of project sustainability techniques, a model for conceptualizing
  the role of open source community building activities throughout projects and an
  initial model for key institutional roles for projects at different levels of maturity.
