abstract: 'Creation and improvement of tools for digital preservation is a difficult
  task without an established way to assess any progress in their quality. This happens
  due to low presence of solid evidence and a lack of accessible approaches to create
  such evidence. Software benchmarking, as an em-

  pirical method, is used in various fields to provide objective evidence about the
  quality of software tools. However, the

  digital preservation field is still missing a proper adoption of that method. This
  paper establishes a theory of benchmarking of tools in digital preservation as a
  solid method

  for gathering and sharing the evidence needed to achieve widespread improvements
  in tool quality. To this end, we discuss and synthesize literature and experience
  on the theory and practice of benchmarking as a method and define a conceptual framework
  for benchmarks in digital preservation. Four benchmarks that address different digital
  preservation scenarios are presented. We compare existing reports on tool evaluation
  and how they address the main components of benchmarking, and we discuss the question
  of whether the field possesses the right combination of social factors that make
  benchmarking a promising method at this point in time. The conclusions point to
  significant opportunities for collaborative benchmarks and systematic evidence

  sharing, but also several major challenges ahead.'
