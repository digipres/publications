abstract: Research is critical to the advancement of both a basic understanding and
  the effective practice of digital preservation. Research must, however, be intimately
  linked to practice in order to improve outcomes. This panel will discuss methodology,
  metrics, tools, and exemplars that can effectively build the evidence base for digital
  preservation. Panelists will present on a simulation framework for evaluating preservation
  risks, formal/machine actionable preservation strategies and implementations; and
  evaluation of preservation performance.
