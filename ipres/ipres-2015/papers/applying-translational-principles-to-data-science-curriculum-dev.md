abstract: 'This paper reports on a curriculum mapping study that examined job descriptions
  and advertisements for three data curation focused positions: Data Librarian, Data
  Steward / Curator, and Data Archivist. We present a transferable methodological
  approach for curriculum development and the findings from our evaluation of employer
  requirements for these positions. This paper presents “model pathways” for these
  data curation roles and reflects on opportunities for iSchools to adopt translational
  data science principles to frame and extend their curriculum to prepare their students
  for data-driven career opportunities.'
