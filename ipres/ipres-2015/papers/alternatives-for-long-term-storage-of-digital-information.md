abstract: 'The most fundamental component of digital preservation is managing the
  digital objects in archival repositories. Preservation Repositories must archive
  digital objects and associated metadata on an affordable and reliable type of digital
  storage. There are many storage options available; each institution should evaluate
  the available storage options in order to determine which options are best for their
  particular needs.


  This poster examines three criteria in order to help preservationists determine
  the best storage option for their institution: Cost, Longevity, and the Migration
  Time frame. While Richard Wright maintains that “storage is becoming the lowest
  cost in a digital repository,” Cost is probably the single most important factor
  when considering long term storage. Cost may be a limiting factor in the number
  objects that are preserved. Chapman asserts that repository storage costs “must
  be affordable and manageable or content owners will withhold materials from deposit.”
  Storage costs, even if they are declining, may influence decision makers to select
  a low-cost storage option, at the expense of essential preservation needs. DeRidder,
  in her presentation “Considerations for Storage and Protection of Content”, lists
  Cost as the first factor in choosing a storage media option.'
