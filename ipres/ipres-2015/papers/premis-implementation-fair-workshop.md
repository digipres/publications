abstract: 'This workshop provides an overview of the PREMIS Data Dictionary for Preservation
  Metadata, a standard addressing the information you need to know to preserve digital
  content in a

  repository. It includes a brief introduction to PREMIS and the

  launch of version 3.0, which changes the data model. In addition there are reports
  from the preservation community on implementation of the standard in various systems
  or contexts, in particular the integration of preservation systems that support
  PREMIS with other digital management systems.'
