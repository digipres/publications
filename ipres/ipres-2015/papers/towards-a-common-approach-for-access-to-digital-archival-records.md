abstract: 'This paper describes how the E-ARK project (European Archival Records and
  Knowledge Preservation) aims to develop an overarching methodology for curating
  digital assets. This methodology must address business needs and operational issues,
  proposing a technical wall-to-wall reference implementation for the core OAIS flow
  - Ingest, Archival Storage and Access.


  The focal point of the article is the Access part of the OAIS flow. The paper first
  lays out the access vision of the E-ARK project, and secondly describes the method
  employed to enable information processing and to pin-point the functional and non-functional
  requirements. These requirements will allow the E-ARK project to create a standardized
  format for the Dissemination Information Package (DIP), and to develop the access
  tools that will process this format. The paper then proceeds to describe the DIP
  format before detailing what the access solution will look like, which tools will
  be developed and, not least, why the E-ARK Access system will be used and work.'
