abstract: 'This poster will present the headline results from the Open Preservation
  Community Survey 2015, which surveyed over 130 institutions around the world to
  establish the current state of the art in digital preservation practice. The survey
  focused on technology adoption and real-world infrastructure and architectures,
  including demographics about the type and size of the responding institution. The
  responses include: staff roles and allocations; core digital preservation activities;
  content types accepted for long-term management; storage capacity and models; use
  of the cloud and consortial solutions; use of open source; repository and workflow
  systems; and tool adoption. The survey did not ask about policies or costs. In addition,
  comparisons are drawn with the PLANETS survey from 2009 to show changes in requirements
  and practice over time. The published analysis and raw data will be forthcoming
  by the end of 2015.'
