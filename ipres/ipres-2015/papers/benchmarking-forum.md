abstract: This proposal is for a full day workshop to be held at the IPRES 2015 conference.
  The focus of the workshop will be on areas in the digital preservation field which
  could benefit from benchmarking. Benchmarking is a method of comparing entities
  against a well-defined standard (i.e. benchmark). The workshop is focused on discussing
  software benchmarking practices in digital preservation and how these can contribute
  to improving digital preservation tools.
