abstract: 'In 2014, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) Libraries implemented
  the Rosetta preservation software to take a more proactive approach to the preservation
  of digital materials for which UNL Libraries are stewards. A significant part of
  this process was determining how to integrate this new software into the Libraries’
  current workflows and ecosystem for digital materials. This included considering
  the varied origins of digital materials; determining the purpose of collections
  and whether preservation was necessary and, if so, a priority; considering deposit
  strategies; understanding the rights related to the materials, including whether
  or not they should be accessible and to whom; and implementing policies that outline
  in which systems digital materials of certain types should reside.


  This poster will illustrate UNL Libraries’ progress toward implementing Rosetta
  in its digital material ecosystem. A diagram presenting the relevant technical ‘pieces’
  and accompanying explanatory text will demonstrate how preservation—more specifically,
  Rosetta—fits into the puzzle of digital material storage, access, and management.
  In addition, the poster will reflect on the challenges encountered attempting to
  fit all of the pieces together.'
