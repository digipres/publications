abstract: Since its founding in 1977, University Archives and Special Collections
  at California State University Long Beach has collected syllabi from the classes
  offered during the academic year. Tens of thousands of syllabi exist in paper format,
  and thousands more exist on CD in various electronic formats. This poster describes
  efforts to transform syllabi collection into an all-digital process, while providing
  for the future preservation of historical syllabi.
