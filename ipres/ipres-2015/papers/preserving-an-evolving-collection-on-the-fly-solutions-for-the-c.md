abstract: 'As digital scholarship continues to transform research, so it

  changes the way we present and publish it. In archaeology, this

  has meant a transition from the traditional print monograph,

  representing the “definitive” interpretation of a site or landscape,

  to an online, open, and interactive model in which data collections

  have become central. Online representations of archaeological

  research must achieve transparency, exposing the connections

  between fieldwork and research methods, data objects, metadata,

  and derived conclusions. Accomplishing this often requires

  multiple platforms that can be burdensome to integrate and

  preserve. To address this, the Institute of Classical Archaeology

  and the Texas Advanced Computing Center have developed a

  “collection architecture” that integrates disparate and distributed

  cyberinfrastructure resources through a customized automated

  metadata platform, along with procedures for data presentation

  and preservation. The system supports “on-the-fly” data archiving

  and publication, as the collection is organized, shared,

  documented, analyzed, and distributed.'
