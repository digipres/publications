abstract: 'The role of the National Archives of Australia is to promote the creation,
  management and preservation of authentic, reliable and usable Commonwealth government
  records and enable ongoing public access to the archival resources of the Commonwealth.


  Records that are created by Commonwealth government agencies and transferred to
  the National Archives are, of course, predominately digital. Digital records bring
  a range of challenges, but they also potentially present new opportunities in the
  way archives can conduct their business. This paper outlines a project currently
  underway at the National Archives, named Project Chrysalis, which is an end-to-end
  business system that aims to transform the way in which the Archives does its digital
  business.


  Project Chrysalis represents not just a technical solution, but also significant
  business change for the National Archives. However, if implemented successfully,
  the project should enable the Archives to sustainably harvest, preserve and provide
  access to digital records in the information age.'
