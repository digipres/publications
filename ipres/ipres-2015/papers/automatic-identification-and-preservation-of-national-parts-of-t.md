abstract: 'Preservation of our cultural heritage on the Internet is increasingly in
  danger of getting lost due to the challenges faced when collecting it. An increasing
  amount of national webpages are moving to generic Top Level Domains like .com or
  .org. The movement is so fast that we are at risk of losing it, since we do not
  get in time to identify the change before it has disappeared again. Therefore this
  question becomes increasingly crucial for organizations covering digital national
  heritage including web archives for a specific country.


  This poster presents the results from a research project that evaluated two different
  automated approaches to recognise webpages outside a country’s Top Level Domain
  which are part the country’s cultural heritage. One suggested approach has been
  to base extraction of national material on a snapshot of the entire Internet in
  form of a worldwide crawl. Another suggested approach is more silo oriented, based
  on harvests of web pages referred to by webpages within a National Top Level Domain.'
