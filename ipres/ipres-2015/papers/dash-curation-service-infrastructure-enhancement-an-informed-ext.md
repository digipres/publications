abstract: University libraries and data repositories are increasingly being asked
  to support research data curation as a consequence of funder mandates, pre-publication
  requirements, institutional policies, and evolving norms of scholarly practice.
  While free commercial alternatives such as figshare and Dropbox provide high service
  functionality and intuitive user experience that serve research data creators well,
  they do not offer long term preservation reliability, nor do they necessarily share
  the increasingly important value of open data. From the perspective of the research
  data creator, however, all of these factors are important and desirable, so a preservation
  repository service targeting the needs of researchers should provide them. The UC
  Curation Center (UC3) at the California Digital Library created its Dash research
  data portal to address these needs. Following the initial deployment of the Dash
  service UC3 received feedback from users that additional functionality and a redesigned
  user interface would be desirable. With funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation
  UC3 has re-factored the infrastructure behind Dash, and improved the front-end user
  experience of the existing deposit service. The Dash submission, harvesting, and
  discovery components are being extended to apply to any standards-compliant repository
  supporting the SWORD submission and OAI-PMH metadata harvesting protocols.
