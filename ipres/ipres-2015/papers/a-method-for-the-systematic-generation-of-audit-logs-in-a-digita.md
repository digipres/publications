abstract: 'In a digital preservation environment there is a need for a complete auditing
  of the change of the system state. A complete log ensures that the properties of
  the objects in the system can be verified. Modern data management systems such as
  the integrated Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS) allow administrators to configure
  complex policies. Pre- or

  post-operation, these policies can trigger other state changing operations. In this
  paper, we describe a method that allows us - given a complete list of state changing
  operations - to generate a complete audit log of the system. We

  also describe an experimental implementation of the framework. An important advantage
  of our method is that not only do we build on sound theoretical foundations, but
  we

  also validate the methodology in a production ready environment which has undergone
  substantial quality control.  The implementation of our method can be distributed
  as a

  turnkey solution that is ready to deploy, which significantly shortens the gap between
  theoretical development and practical applications.'
