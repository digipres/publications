abstract: Oracle Public Cloud offers data backup and archive services with a high
  level of data availability and at an affordable cost. This demonstration highlights
  key capabilities for direct usage of Oracle Storage and Archive Services via Openstack
  Swift API's and NFS interfaces. In addition, it also showcases integrated solutions
  using storage management tools such as iRODS and CommVault. A review of how both
  the technical and economic features of Archival Cloud Computing can be employed
  in new preservation infrastructure modeling, use cases, and academic and business
  scenarios will be given. The Oracle Archival Cloud offers new infrastructure opportunities
  to institutions.
