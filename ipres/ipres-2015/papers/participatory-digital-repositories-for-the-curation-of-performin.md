abstract: The complexity of socio-technical systems in artistic production involving
  digital technology, especially in the performing arts, challenges digital curation
  models with a potential shift from cycles to networks. We argue that digital curation
  models need to develop in parallel to interdisciplinary investigations of these
  systems. These investigations question the conceptual separation of curation stages
  as well as roles. In this paper, we build on previous curation projects for new
  media arts and on the historical analysis of a specific work of contemporary music
  with live electronics to propose future directions for the integration of curation
  practices, artistic practices and digital curation models.
