abstract: 'Fedora is a flexible, extensible repository platform for the management
  and dissemination of digital content. Fedora 4, the newly released, revitalized
  version of Fedora, introduces a host of new features and functionality that both
  new and existing Fedora users are interested in learning about and experiencing
  first-hand.

  This tutorial will provide an introduction to and overview of Fedora 4, with a focus
  on the latest features. Fedora 4 implements the W3C Linked Data Platform recommendation,
  so a section of the tutorial will be dedicated to a discussion about LDP and the
  implications for Fedora 4 and linked data. Fedora 4 is also designed to be integrated
  with other applications, so a section of the tutorial will review common applications
  and integrations patterns. Finally, attendees will participate in a hands-on session
  that will give them a chance to install, configure, and explore Fedora 4 by following
  step-by-step instructions.'
