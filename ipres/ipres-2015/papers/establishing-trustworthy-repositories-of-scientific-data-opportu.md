abstract: Scientific progress often depends on the ability of the scientific community
  to build on the works of others. Such works include scientific data, published reports
  of findings, and other research-related information and artifacts that are produced
  as part of the scientific process. Providing capabilities for accessing and using
  such scientific works enables the reproducibility of published methods and results
  to identify opportunities for improvement. Access and use of science products also
  enables others to build on previous work. In an increasingly digital world, the
  science community accesses and uses relevant scientific resources that have been
  obtained from digital repositories, data centers, and archives, as well as from
  traditional sources such as publishers of journal articles. Digital repositories
  need to establish capabilities, which provide access to and enable the use of digital
  resources. These resources are needed by the science community to improve and build
  on the efforts of others. Digital repositories that provide free and unrestricted
  access to scientific data and research-related information can reduce the barriers
  to science. By reducing these barriers they will be able to offer opportunities
  for members of the scientific community to pursue research questions and challenges
  that were previously unapproachable. These may include opportunities for researchers
  to gather data from other domains and support interdisciplinary research. Opportunities
  to use the data products and services offered by digital repositories also can contribute
  to the development of the scientific community and to the emergence of new areas
  of study.
