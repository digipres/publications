abstract: The E-ARK project (E-ARK is funded by the European Commissionâ€™s FP7 PSP)
  is addressing several major challenges faced by archives and institutions/researchers
  preparing data to send to archives. With the recent emphasis on open access, there
  has been a sea-change regarding discovery and archival material, so that citizens,
  businesses and academic researchers as well as the archives and data providers themselves
  can look forward to novel ways of analyzing archival data. E-ARK is half way through
  its three-year timespan, and has already produced some concrete solutions to real
  challenges in this problem space. This poster will graphically demonstrate the various
  challenges and show how E-ARK is meeting them now, or plans to in the future.
