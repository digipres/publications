abstract: 'Software often plays a key role in the ways that institutions function,
  and some institutions, like the National Library of Medicine (NLM), have a history
  of developing software to serve their unique needs. Preserving this in-house developed
  software is the goal of the National Digital Stewardship Residency Project, “NLM-Developed
  Software as Cultural Heritage.” This project will not only help ensure access to
  content created on this software, but, in the case of NLM, will also help document
  a long and often unrecognized intellectual history [1]. Although copyright concerns
  are largely avoided since the software was produced in-house, a variety of administrative
  obstacles still need to be addressed before the technical process of software preservation
  can begin. These obstacles include but are not limited to: (1) locating knowledge
  sources for software projects that are long defunct; (2) locating usable copies
  of software, either tangible or intangible, that may not have been properly documented
  or stored; and (3) tracing the history of projects that may have gone through several
  re-branding efforts or versioning’s. This poster will address these issues as they
  have affected the current project at NLM and will demonstrate how a properly conducted
  inventory is necessary for contending with these obstacles and ensuring a reliable
  long-term software preservation strategy.'
