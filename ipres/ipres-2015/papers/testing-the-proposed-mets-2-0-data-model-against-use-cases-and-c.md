abstract: The Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS) 1.x schema has an
  established community of users including academic and national libraries, archives,
  and museums as well as support from a number of commercial and open source tool
  and service vendors. While the established community of METS users has adapted systems
  and tools to METS expressed in XML, many in the library and archive communities
  are moving toward the use of newer technologies such as those of the Semantic Web
  and linked data for the digital content that they have been collecting. As a result,
  the METS Editorial Board (MEB) has been contemplating a data model for a next generation
  METS schema that will facilitate these kinds of technologies. The initial approach
  to a new METS data model aligned very closely to metadata schemes in the preservation
  arena, namely PREMIS, but the MEB thought it essential to test the new METS 2.0
  data model against existing canonical implementations of METS, and developing complementary
  data models. This workshop will describe current and ongoing efforts to evaluate
  and further develop a new METS data model. Participants are invited to participate
  in the discussions, and the subsequent evaluation / refinement of a METS 2.0 data
  model.
