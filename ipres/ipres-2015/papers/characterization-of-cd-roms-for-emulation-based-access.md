abstract: 'Memory institutions have already collected a substantial amount of digital
  objects, predominantly CD-ROMs. Some of them are already inaccessible with current
  systems, most of them will be soon. Emulation offers a viable strategy for long-term
  access to these publications. However, these collections are huge and the objects
  are missing technical metadata to setup a suitable emulated environment. In this

  paper we propose a pragmatic approach to technical metadata

  which we use to implement a characterization tool to suggest a suitable emulated
  rendering environment.'
