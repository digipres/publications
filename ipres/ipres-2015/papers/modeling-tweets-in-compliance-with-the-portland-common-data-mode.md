abstract: 'The ingest of non-traditional digital library collections into a linked
  data-based institutional repository for archival and presentation purposes is challenging
  on many levels. We

  propose a model for Twitter data that is compliant with the Portland Common Data
  Model. Based on this model, we

  can derive a linked data serialization and perform the ingest into our preservation
  repository.'
