abstract: 'In this paper, we describe an OAIS aligned data model and architectural
  design that enables us to archive digital information with a single core preservation
  workflow. The data

  model allows for normalization of metadata from widely varied domains to ingest
  and manage the submitted information utilizing only one generalized toolchain and
  be able to create access platforms that are tailored to designated data consumer
  communities. The design of the preservation system is not dependent on its components
  to continue to exist over its lifetime, as we anticipate changes both of technology
  and

  environment. The initial implementation depends mainly on the open-source tools
  Archivematica, Fedora/Islandora,

  and iRODS.'
