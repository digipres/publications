abstract: 'The National Library of France (BnF) has recently implemented a new module
  for its Scalable Preservation and Archiving Repository (SPAR) to set up preservation
  strategies based on formats, agents, workflows, tools and tests, and managed as
  reference packages in the Archive.


  This module aims to fulfill an objective: for SPAR to be fully self-documented.
  Formats, agents and workflows are formally described and preserved along with the
  Information packages in which such elements are involved. Although this was a feature
  that was included from the beginnings of SPAR, the new Preservation Planning module
  aims to provide a tool that can more easily build these reference packages and that
  will more closely involve domain experts and the IT department in the processes
  of preservation planning. But the main innovation lies in the documentation of decisions
  that directed their selection as standards in SPAR: test data are now preserved
  as a new kind of reference package.'
