abstract: 'This poster describes some of the challenges for managing web archive collections
  when they intersect with research data preservation. A web archive collection at
  the University of Alberta inadvertently harvested large data files from another
  institution which resulted in overloading the subscription budget for Archive-IT.
  A discussion followed about the appropriate policy approaches for web archive programs
  when they encounter research data on the web. The poster presents some of the evaluation
  criteria used to make decisions about including or excluding research data from
  web archives. Existing web archive tools are ill-prepared to deal with research
  data. Furthermore, responsibility for preserving research data and web documents
  is difficult to determine. Finally, the role of third-parties outside of the original
  institutions where research data is created is still unclear.

  Future activity in this area should address these challenges.'
