abstract: This poster documents work recently undertaken at Emory Universityâ€™s Manuscript,
  Archives, and Rare Book Library (MARBL) to review policy on disk image file formats
  used to capture and store digital content in our Fedora repository. Survey of the
  field and current best practices revealed waning support for the formats previously
  used and prompted collaborative efforts between Digital Archives staff and software
  engineers to migrate existing disk images to formats now deemed more suitable for
  long-term digital preservation.
