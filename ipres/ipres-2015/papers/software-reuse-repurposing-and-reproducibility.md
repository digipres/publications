abstract: Software underpins the academic research process, regardless of discipline.
  With the increased focus on the long term value of data and other research outputs,
  then more attention needs to be paid to how software used in these processes is
  both identified and preserved for the long term as much data is meaningless without
  the related software. In this poster we describe the aims, objectives and current
  results of the Jisc funded project Software Reuse, Repurposing and Reproducibility
  (Software RRR). This poster discusses the issues around persistently identifying
  software, makes some recommendations for good practice, and discusses the relationship
  between identifying source code and a playable version of this software.
