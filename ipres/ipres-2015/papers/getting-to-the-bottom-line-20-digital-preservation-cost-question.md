abstract: 'Getting to the Bottom Line: 20 Cost Questions for Digital Preservation
  is a cost-gathering resource created by the Outreach Committee of the MetaArchive
  Cooperative in Spring 2015.  Launched during an Association of Southeastern Research
  Libraries (ASERL) webinar (https://vimeo.com/121926212) on

  March 11, 2015, this resource has been shared broadly with libraries, archives,
  and other institutions that have an interest in procuring digital preservation services.
  The easy-to-use resource

  is designed to equip institutions with questions that they can use

  to identify the full range of costs that might be associated with any particular
  digital preservation service--proprietary, community-sourced, or otherwise. For
  a variety of reasons, services of all

  types do not always make their costs as transparent as institutions might prefer.
  Using the Getting to the Bottom Line question-set will help ensure that institutions
  do not leave any stones unturned when evaluating their options and that they gather
  the information

  that they need to make informed choices that lead to sustainable

  solutions. Institutions are encouraged to make free use of the questions, adapt
  them as needed, and provide feedback on their usefulness. Going forward, the resource
  will serve as a foundation

  for building additional and more sophisticated cost transparency

  resources targeted toward the digital preservation community.'
