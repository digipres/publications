abstract: The engaged membership of the National Digital Stewardship Alliance’s Standards
  and Practices (S&P) Working Group are active digital preservation practitioners.
  One of five National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA) working groups, S&P projects
  and discussions originate from real-world issues that members face in their daily
  work. Since 2010, the S&P has sought to identify community knowledge gaps for the
  “on-the-ground practitioners” across a broad spectrum of content areas and to work
  collaboratively to bridge those gaps. Some of the topics recently addressed by the
  S&P include preservation of digital artworks, issues related to optical media, stumbling
  blocks for preserving video collections and analyzing risks and benefits of the
  PDF/A3 format for archival institutions among many others. Using the visual imagery
  of a fruit tree, this poster explores the grass roots nature of S&P projects and
  products, from the foundational member institutions comprising the soil and roots,
  through the trunk and branches of the tree addressing different topics, and finally
  reaching to the individual leaves and fruit representing project outcomes and deliverables,
  as well as work still to do. The goal of the poster is to highlight the self-organizing
  nature of the S&P’s varied projects as well as to increase community awareness of
  the collaboratively developed resources and products.
