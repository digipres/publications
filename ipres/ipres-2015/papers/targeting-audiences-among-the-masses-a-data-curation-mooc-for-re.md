abstract: 'In this poster, we illustrate the work of the IMLS-funded Curating Research
  Assets and Data Using Lifecycle Education (CRADLE) project in developing a data
  curation massive open online course (MOOC) targeted to two distinct audiences: researchers
  who are becoming increasingly burdened with data management policies, and information
  professionals tasked to support these researchers. The poster describes data curation
  concepts selected for its applicability to both audiences as well as how content
  and delivery of educational materials are varied to enable students to achieve learning
  objectives.'
