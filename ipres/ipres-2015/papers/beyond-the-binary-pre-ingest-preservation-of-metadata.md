abstract: This paper describes some of the challenges the National Library of New
  Zealand has faced in our efforts to maintain the authenticity of born digital collection
  items from first transfer to the Library through ingest into our digital preservation
  system. We assume that assuring the authenticity and integrity of digital objects
  means preserving the binary objects plus metadata about the objects. We discuss
  the efforts and challenges of the Library to preserve contextual metadata around
  the binary object, in particular filenames and file dates. We discuss these efforts
  from the two perspectives of the digital archivist and the digital preservation
  analyst, and how these two perspectives inform our current thinking.
