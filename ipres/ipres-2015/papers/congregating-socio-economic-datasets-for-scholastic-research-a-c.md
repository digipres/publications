abstract: Digital curation initiatives with an intention to preserve the intellectual
  content of an institute gained momentum in the early 1990s with open source technologies
  facilitating such efforts. Indian Institute of Management Library (hitherto referred
  as IIMB library in this paper) heralded onto a new path of making primary datasets
  about socio-economic datasets, including the massive census reports in the digital
  domain. In the year 2014 all National Sample Surveys from the Government of India
  and Census reports from 1881 to 1941 were digitized for internal circulation purposes
  only. Though these efforts were a small step towards digital curation, it raised
  expectations from the user community on the computational potential and data mining
  abilities of these datasets. But to accomplish it, the challenges of digital perpetuity,
  technological obsolescence, dissemination expanded to the public, copyright issues
  have to be overcome.
