abstract: 'The overarching goal of digital libraries and archives are similar - to
  foster the preservation of cultural assets, published or otherwise. Despite this
  common goal, the different tools, terminology, and approaches of libraries and archives
  can impact, sometimes prevent collaboration. This presentation will highlight features
  of the open source Islandora framework that can help bridge the gap between digital
  libraries and archives, leveraging the strengths of both fields of expertise. The
  resulting rich ecosystem can provide an empowering approach to building user-centric
  collections that also achieve the goals of long term preservation.


  This presentation will use examples from the Islandora Open Source Software Community
  and Framework to demonstrate the strides made to bridge the gap.'
