abstract: This panel aims to link research and practice around the preservation necessary
  for meaningful reuse of research data over the long term. Panelists will discuss
  preserving the contexts around the meaning of data that enable assessments of data
  quality necessary for reuse, preserving the bits of data that enable long term access
  across the continuum and rendering, and shaping research data services to address
  the two in a more effective, integrated manner.
