abstract: 'An increasing amount of scientific work is performed in silico, such that
  the entire process of investigation, from experiment to publication, is performed
  by computer. Unfortunately, this has made the problem of scientific reproducibility
  even harder, due to the complexity and imprecision of specifying and recreating
  the computing environments needed to run a given piece of software. Here, we consider
  from a high level what techniques and technologies must be put in place to allow
  for the accurate preservation

  of the execution of software. We assume that there exists a suitable digital archive
  for storing digital objects; what is missing are frameworks for precisely specifying,
  assembling,

  and executing software with all of its dependencies.  We discuss the fundamental
  problems of managing implicit dependencies and outline two broad approaches: preserving
  the mess, and encouraging cleanliness. We introduce three prototype tools for preserving
  software executions: Parrot,

  Umbrella, and Prune.'
