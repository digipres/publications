abstract: 'Researchers in information science are placing increased attention on data
  reuse and on what must be preserved with that data to enable meaningful use by scholars
  within and across disciplines. Although the focus has been on scientific or quantitative
  data, this paper expands the discussion to qualitative data â€“ specifically digital
  video records of practice in the field of education. This is an interesting case
  because researchers and diverse education professionals are interested in reusing
  this content, though their needs differ. We focus on three issues that raise challenges
  for preservation and access: file format, context, and dissemination.'
