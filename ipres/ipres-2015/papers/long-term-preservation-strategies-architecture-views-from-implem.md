abstract: 'Join us for a panel presentation on the dark side of preservation. This
  panel will address the current state of long-term digital preservation and where
  we''ve come in the last decade. The presenters will review the tools and techniques
  for their projects and how they work. The panel will engage in an open discussion
  on the issues around long-term digital preservation, including: costs, technology,
  hurdles (technical and political) and planning for the future. The panel will also
  address how long-term digital preservation transcends disciplinary boundaries of
  librarianship and computer science and what values are implicit in the work and
  activities.'
