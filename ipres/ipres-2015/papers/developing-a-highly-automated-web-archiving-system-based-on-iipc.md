abstract: 'In this paper, we describe our development of a highly automated

  web archiving system based on IIPC open source software at the National Science
  Library (NSL). We designed a web archiving platform which integrates with popular
  IIPC tools, as well as

  developing several modules to meet special requirements of the NSL. We have applied
  a cooperative mode of central management server and collecting client, which can
  complete the unified management of seeds and support the collaborative work of

  multiple crawlers. Some modules were developed to improve the automation of web
  archiving workflows and provide more services.'
