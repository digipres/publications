abstract: The 2015 National Agenda for Digital Stewardship calls for stewardship organizations
  to engage content creators to improve the capture and preservation of born-digital
  content. This panel will provide an overview of three different efforts to reach
  out to different communities who create content that stewardship organizations want
  to acquire and preserve. The Dance Heritage Coalition will present outcomes from
  their Knight funded project to work directly with dance companies and critics to
  capture born-digital content documenting dance and dance performance. Efforts of
  the U.S. Federal Web Archiving Working Group to interact with federal webmasters
  to improve the capture and preservability of federal information and government
  web sites will also be covered. Finally, building relationships with community news
  media and developing donor agreements for the transfer of assets will be discussed.
  Other born-digital content areas could also be covered.
