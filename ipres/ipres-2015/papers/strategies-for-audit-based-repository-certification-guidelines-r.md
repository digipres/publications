abstract: In this poster, we present the current status, lessons learned, and best
  practices experienced thus far in the preparation for audit and certification of
  the Government Publishing Officeâ€™s FDsys as a Trustworthy Digital Repository. The
  poster will serve as an introduction to a future, publically accessible toolkit
  and set of resources and case studies for use within repositories seeking an audit-based
  approach of evaluation.
