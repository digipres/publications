abstract: 'PREservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies working group, or PREMIS,
  has been an activity jointly sponsored by OCLC and RLG, focusing on issues associated
  with implementing preservation metadata in digital archiving systems. It was established
  to develop a common, implementable core set of metadata elements for digital preservation,
  since most published specifications for preservation-related metadata are either
  implementation-specific or broadly theoretical. Comprised of nearly 30 international
  experts representing national and university libraries, museums, archives, government
  agencies, and the private sector, PREMIS was charged to define a set of semantic
  units that are implementation-independent, practically-oriented, and likely to be
  needed by most preservation repositories as well as to identify and evaluate alternative
  strategies for encoding, storing, managing, and exchanging the core elements within
  a digital archiving system.

  As part of the PREMIS work, existing preservation repositories were surveyed about
  their architectural models and metadata practices. The result, documented in the
  report Implementing Preservation Repositories for Digital Materials: Current Practice
  and Emerging Trends in the Cultural Heritage Community, summarized survey responses
  which addressed the mission, policy, economic, and technical aspects of digital
  repositories, as well as current practices for creating, managing, and maintaining
  preservation metadata within the repository environment. Analysis of the survey
  responses suggests that the digital preservation community is beginning to coalesce
  around several emerging trends and best practices in the use and management of preservation
  metadata.

  In May 2005, the PREMIS working group released its final deliverable: the final
  report. The semantic units that support long term preservation are represented in
  a data dictionary with implementation details and in METS-compatible XML schemas.
  Examples of the metadata elements applied against a range of digital objects are
  also a component of the report. A glossary of terms and concepts, a data model,
  and a typology of relationships developed during the course of the work further
  supplements PREMIS’s contributions to the cultural heritage community. The presentation
  will discuss the work of PREMIS, the resulting reports and preservation metadata
  tools, as well as the ongoing PREMIS maintenance activities.'
