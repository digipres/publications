abstract: 'All we know about predicting our digital future is based on our past, a
  review of which reveals a remarkable truth dating from the beginning of the digital
  era: plain text is a versatile and lossless format that is just as readable with
  today''s computers as it was 30 years ago. Compared to the fonts, colors, point
  sizes, and graphics available in contemporary formats, plain text may look dull
  and dry, but in fact this "desiccated data" successfully represents all the protocols
  that built the Internet.

  Moreover, it is hard to imagine its not being nominated as the most likely current
  format to be readable 30 years from now. A proposed strategy for preserving today''s
  web formats is to go ahead and save the original format, but also to automatically
  derive and save various "desiccated" versions that, while failing to capture all
  the original format''s richness, nonetheless capture its essential nutrient value.
  In the case of a document, saving a plain text format version alongside the original
  would provide a fall back in case the original format failed. One never knows if
  there will ever be money enough to touch a preserved object again, let alone migrate
  its format. The effort and storage for a derived plain text version is often needed
  anyway to support search indexing.

  Generalizing, the lesson appears to be that the simpler technological intermediation
  required to render the digital object for the user, the easier it is to reproduce
  that intermediation, hence to carry forward the object. Along these lines, the image
  format analog of plain text file might be a basic raster file, in which the array
  of pixels (picture elements) could be seen to mimic ancient weaving technology.
  It may be that adding the complication of a simple run-length encoding compression
  would be worth the space savings. A strategy for deriving and saving raster images
  of original documents rendered with today''s software has two advantages: we will
  never have better rendering tools for today''s formats than today (with all the
  features and error-compensation that make malformed format instances -- very common
  -- renderable) and it provides an additional fall back in case the original and
  the plain text fail. This is something we can do for preservation today that we
  may never have the money or the knowledge to do in the future.'
