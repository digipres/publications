abstract: 'Publications were traditionally distributed in the form of print media,
  but with the advent of global electronic networks many are now being disseminated
  as digital documents. This evolutionary shift significantly changes the task profile
  of libraries and especially concerns archive libraries, which are entrusted with
  the preservation of a nation''s cultural heritage. As libraries expand their scope
  to accommodate digital objects, they can no longer resort to established methods
  for archiving print, but must adapt their organisation and operation to meet a completely
  new set of requirements.

  These new requirements are spelled out within the framework of Information Lifecycle
  Management (ILM), which is used in industry and commerce as a standard model for
  such analysis. This analysis also enables Die Deutsche Bibliothek''s present situation
  to be mapped out in a generalized manner. ILM boils down to a strategic model for
  actively managing the storage and retrieval of digital objects throughout their
  entire life cycle. Which guidelines, methods and instruments are best suited to
  provide a cost-effective and mission-adequate infrastructure for archived data and
  their accessory applications?

  Die Deutsche Bibliothek is currently leading the cooperative development of a deposit
  system for digital resources (kopal: Co-operative Development of a Long-Term Digital
  Information Archive), which will be presented as a background for discussing key
  aspects of these requirements and their consequences for systems implementation.
  A final step will illustrate the practical impact of these consequences on the operating
  processes which are currently being developed.'
