abstract: 'One of the versatile tasks of the project nestor is to develop guidelines
  for the long-term preservation of digital objects in Germany and to propose national
  preservation strategies. A national preservation policy forms the framework for
  the efforts within the long-term preservation and thus determines intentions, aims
  and responsibilities. A possible preservation policy needs to consider a range of
  different factors, as e.g.

  - the federal structure in Germany and thus the relation between the Federal Government
  and the several States

  - the interests of the particular institutions (archives, libraries, museums, universities
  etc.)

  - the needs which result from managing different material (text, image, audio, primary
  data etc.) and

  - the different professional and financial responsibilities as well as the rights
  issues that are inherent in the digital preservation.

  This paper will summarize the results that have been made in the nestor project
  concerning the development of a national preservation policy.'
