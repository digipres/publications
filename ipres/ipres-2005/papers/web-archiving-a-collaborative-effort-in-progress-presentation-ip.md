abstract: 'The web is a virtually infinite information space, and archiving its entirety,
  all its aspects, is a Utopia. The amount of information presents a challenge, but
  it is neither the only, nor the most limiting one given the continuous drop in storage
  device costs. Significant challenges lie in the management and technical issues
  of the location and collection of web sites. They will be briefly presented.

  Because of this, archiving the web is a task that no single institution can fulfil
  alone. It requires a collaborative effort in which there is a natural division of
  roles in space (breadth and depth of the information space) as well as a potential
  functional division of tasks. But working collaboratively in this domain entails
  a methodological clarification as well as the definition of common standards & tools
  in a domain where traditional preservation practices have been unprecedented challenged.
  Progress in this domain will be presented, mainly carried out by the International
  Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC) a consortium of 12 national libraries and
  the Internet Archive.

  Web archiving requires also the mastering of complex processes in an extremely diverse
  and continuously changing technological environment. The emergence of a new type
  of technology partners for cultural institutions will also be presented with the
  example of collaboration between the Internet Archive and the European digital Archive
  with archives and libraries.'
