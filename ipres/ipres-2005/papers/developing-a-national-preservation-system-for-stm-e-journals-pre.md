abstract: 'China is facing urgent needs for collaborative digital preservation strategies.
  The situation is more acute for foreign STM materials critical to key research and
  educational institutes, because, on one hand, in all of those institutes, STM e-journals
  becomes the major part of their library resources and represents the main streams
  of use, on the other hand, few of them have developed strategies and plans for long-term
  preservation and fewer have placed these efforts in a nationally coordinated and
  collaborative context.

  In this presentation, following an analysis of current practices in STM digital
  resources management in China, challenges are briefly explored for implementing
  an economically sound, service reliable, and organizationally sustainable digital
  preservation undertaking, and needs are recognized for a nationally collaborative
  preservation strategy and its corresponding policy framework to guide and coordinate
  preservation efforts of each and all the institutes.

  Structure models for Chinese national collaborative STM preservation networks are
  elaborated, considering (1) the technological, economic, administrative, and managerial
  responsibilities incurred by joining the national network, (2) the existing structures
  and responsibility schemes of current library systems, consortia, and other collaboration
  arrangements, especially in terms of digital resource development, and (3) various
  possible responsibility relations among various players, of any national preservation
  network, such as owners, preserving institutions, repository managers, targeted
  service audience, and preservation funding agencies, etc. Special consideration
  is further extended to the requirements for and possible implementation schemes
  for fail-safe mechanisms and succession planning in different contexts.

  Policies for implementing and managing a nationally coordinated distributed network
  of trustable repositories are further discussed, including the selecting and entrusting
  of repository managers, coordinating and monitoring their preservation ingest, planning
  and management, and provision of public services, and evaluating operations and
  management soundness, for openly verifiable and collaboratively manageable repository
  network; Integration of the national STM digital preservation system into the national
  science and technology infrastructure (NSTI) is discussed, including incorporating
  digital preservation into NSTI strategy and policy framework, organizing preservation
  repositories as part of NSTI services, coordinating preservations of STM publications
  with preservation efforts of other scientific resources (such as scientific data),
  and very importantly, channel NSTI funding into development and maintenance of the
  national STM preservation network.'
