abstract: 'In the decade since publication of the report of the Task Force on "Archiving
  of Digital Information", there has been a plethora of research initiatives focused
  on the challenges that surround the long-term preservation of digital content. These
  initiatives have collectively been very successful in raising awareness of the digital
  preservation challenge, and have also produced a wide range of output types, e.g.,
  policy documents, reference models, training materials, standards, software, etc.

  However, the realities of project organisation and funding mean that digital preservation
  research is usually specific to a particular organisation or professional world-view.
  The current challenge is to integrate these fragmented initiatives into a coherent
  multidisciplinary research framework.

  The presentation will provide an outline of how this challenge is now being addressed,
  focusing on the work of the digital preservation cluster of the DELOS Network of
  Excellence on Digital Libraries, the UK Digital Curation Centre, and other initiatives. '
