abstract: 'Many digital objects have a lasting value and significance. As an important
  part of our cultural heritage they need to be collected and preserved for current
  and future generations of researchers. In the analogue world we have established
  criteria for selection, standardized technologies and well defined responsibilities
  for preservation. In the digital world, responsibilities, technology and selection
  have to be redefined and established. There is an urgent need to do this, because
  digital objects have a limited shelf life and the risk of loss is therefore imminent.
  This is especially true for the preservation of the great number of freely floating
  objects in the World Wide Web. But the mere storage of digital content is not even
  enough. A true preservation strategy also needs to ensure the long term accessibility
  to and usage of the stored objects. It is this combination of long term storage
  and long term usability that defines a "trusted digital repository".

  Developing the right technology and establishing the adequate organisational structure
  is not an easy task, but setting up criteria of selection might even be harder.
  We need answers to the question what documents researchers need today and what they
  will need tomorrow or in the far future. We need the right guidelines for selection
  or valuable resources will have disappeared tomorrow.

  Because of the high-speed, high-price, high-risk issues of digital preservation,
  it can only be addressed in a cooperative way. What is needed is a coordinated web
  of trusted digital repositories with preservation policies that guarantee long term
  archiving as much as long term usability.'
