abstract: 'Effective digital preservation requires the proper characterization of
  the objects under managed care. In order to provide full access to the underlying
  information content of digital objects, the fundamental characterization property
  is format. Without proper format typing all digital content is opaque. Format typing
  permits the interpretation, rendering, and processing of encoded digital content
  necessary to fulfill the preservation mandate to provide access to stored digital
  content over time. Major format dependencies can be identified in many of the workflows
  defined by the OAIS repository reference model. Fortunately, a new generation of
  format-aware tools and evolving sets of best practices are now becoming available
  for use by preservation managers. However, in many instances the range of formats
  that a digital repository is expected to support will exceed the local format expertise
  of that repository''s preservation staff. This fact, coupled with the long time-scales
  over which an understanding of formats must be maintained, underscores the importance
  of establishing sustainable public registries of format representation information.

  This presentation will review the format dependencies found in preservation workflows,
  survey recent developments in the area of format-aware tools, best practices, and
  registries, and will conclude with two cases studies of preservation-driven format
  migrations.'
