abstract: 'The National Library of Australia collects, archives and provides access
  to a wide range of digital materials, including items from its image, map, manuscript
  and audio digitisation programmes, as well as significant Australian online resources
  harvested from the Web. The Library seeks to provide a safe place for the storage,
  management, preservation and delivery of its digital collections and has developed
  a layered digital services architecture to support these aims.

  This paper provides an overview of the Library''s digital services architecture
  and the systems used to manage its main digital collections. It describes the design
  of the "Digital Collections Manager" and details the ingest and management workflows
  for archiving image and sound materials, including assignment of persistent identifiers
  and recording of object relationships, process histories and technical metadata.
  An overview of PANDAS, the Library''s Web archiving and management system for PANDORA,
  Australia''s Web Archive, is also provided.'
