abstract: In 2003 the digital archiving system of the National Library of the Netherlands
  (KB) was taken into production. This system is called the e-Depot and its technical
  heart is the IBM system called Digital Information Archiving System (DIAS). The
  KB e-Depot is dedicated to the long-term storage of and access to large quantities
  of digital publications. Currently, the system has ingested several millions of
  digital objects. This presentation will explicate how the way we have organized
  the workflow processes in this operational digital archiving environment.
