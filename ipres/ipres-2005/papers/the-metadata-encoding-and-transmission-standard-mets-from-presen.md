abstract: 'As a result of different solutions to describe documents, which had been
  invented with digitization efforts in US libraries in the mid 90ies, the "Metadata
  Encoding and Transmission Standard" derived. The idea was to use a common format
  for different media types (text, image, audio and video streams), which is very
  flexible to support different document models and allows the usage of several metadata
  formats. The "Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard" (METS) is a container
  format to describe digital documents. Derived from early metadata description formats
  as used in "Making of America", it provides a flexible container format not only
  for digitized printed material but also for other digital media as audio and video
  streams. A METS-file keeps all information about the document''s associated objects
  together - including structural data, metadata and contentfiles. Though METS allows
  the description of complex objects, METS files can be very simple. The only required
  object is a structural map which may provide optional links to metadata- and fileobjects.

  The first METS files were used for presentation purposes of digitized material using
  XSLTs to create a TOC from the structural map and to implement simple page turner-software
  to browse image by image through the book (METS file contains metadata about the
  images and provides a link to the TIFF or JPEG file). As documents are getting more
  complex and the requirements to store the content are changing, more and more institutions
  are using document management systems (DMS) to implement repositories. A DMS provides
  additional and improved functionalities for retrieval, management of content files,
  template engines, administration toolkits etc. This functionality becomes available
  for METS files as well, as more and more DMS support METS as their Submission Information
  Package (SIP).

  Preserving content for a long time is still a technical challenge, which requires
  specialized systems. These systems are not only responsible to preserve the bitstreams,
  but also for storing all necessary administrative data, which might be useful for
  future migration etc. These systems are usually compliant with the OAIS model using
  SIPs and DIPs for ingesting and exporting data from the archive. METS as a standarized
  container format is a good choice to import/export data to/from OAIS compliant systems.
  Preservations metadata as defined by PREMIS fits into the administrative metadata
  section of a METS document. Currently the preservation requirements are driving
  the ongoing development of METS. For version 1.5 of the METS schema an extension
  is discussed to allow pointing into file-archives as tar and zip to e.g. attach
  metadata (and other associated objects) to embedded files. '
