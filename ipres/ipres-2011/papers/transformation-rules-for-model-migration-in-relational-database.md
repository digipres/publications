abstract: Digital preservation is about memory and giving easy access to it. If the
  digital object is a relational database the requirements of normalization may make
  it hard to access and understand. In order to deal with this problem we have proposed
  the DBPreserve approach to transform a relational database to a dimensional model
  as part of the preservation process, making the preserved information more explicit
  and easier to access. The paper presents a set of transformation rules to deal with
  aspects of the migration process such as the identification of the fact tables corresponding
  to the main organizational processes and the choice of the set of relevant dimensions.
  The rules help to keep the traceability of the migration process and to preserve
  integrity and authenticity. The rules were implemented in a case study which involved
  a human resources information system.
