abstract: Risk is a constant in every area and at all levels of any organization,
  whether in a general context or in a specific activity, project or function. Risk
  Management comprises a set of coordinated activities to direct and control an organization
  with regard to risk. Risk Assessment is considered the most important phase of Risk
  Management, which consists in identifying, analyzing and evaluating risks. Digital
  preservation’s main concern is to keep information accessible and understandable
  over a long period of time, through means of digital objects; therefore, it is an
  area that needs a thorough Risk Management and, especially, a thorough Risk Assessment.
  In fact, the digital preservation process can be seen as Risk Management activities
  to protect digital information from inherent threats and vulnerabilities. The digital
  preservation problem can be even more complex in the context of e-Science, which
  is progressively being considered as a reference method for experimental scientific
  discovery, and whose data and processes need to be handled and preserved. As such,
  this paper analyzes the applicability of Risk Assessment techniques, in the context
  of digital preservation and, more concretely, in the preservation of e-Science data
  and processes, in order to develop a Risk Assessment method that can be applied
  while managing the life-cycle of digital information.
