abstract: The requirements to support large-scale and complex research collections
  are growing at an accelerated pace. Considering the continuous evolution of the
  collections, their increasing sizes, the technologies supporting them, and the importance
  of adequate data management to long-term preservation, a team at the Texas Advanced
  Computing Center (TACC) developed a cyberinfrastructure to aid researchers in the
  creation, management, and curation of collections throughout the research lifecycle
  processes and beyond for access and long term preservation. Collections are maintained
  on a petabyte-scale data applications facility, and consulting services are available
  to address data curation needs. In this environment, researchers have the flexibility
  to build their collections without having to deal with details such as systems administration
  and hardware migration planning. The cyberinfrastructure facilitates the development
  of sustainable collections and a seamless transition through data gathering and
  curation, large-scale analysis, and collections dissemination and preservation.
