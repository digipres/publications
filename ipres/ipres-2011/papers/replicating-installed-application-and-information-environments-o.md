abstract: 'Digital objects are often more complex than their common perception as
  individual files or small sets of files. Standard digital preservation methods can
  lose important parts of digital objects, or the context of digital objects. To deal
  with the different types of complex digital objects, and to cope with their special
  requirements, we propose applying emulation from a different perspective in order
  to preserve the whole original environment of single digital objects or groups of
  digital objects. Many of today''s preservation scenarios would benefit from a change
  in our understanding of digital objects. Our understanding should be shifted up
  from the single digital files or small groups of files as they are commonly conceived
  of, to full computer systems. When this shift in perspective is undertaken two important
  outcomes result: 1. the subject of preservation includes a much richer level of
  context and 2. the tools available for preserving them are constricted. In this
  paper we describe a workflow to be used for replicating installed application environments
  that have the x86 architecture onto emulated or virtualized hardware, we discuss
  the potential for automating steps in the workflow and conclude by addressing some
  of the possible issues with this approach.'
