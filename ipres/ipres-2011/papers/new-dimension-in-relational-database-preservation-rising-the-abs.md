abstract: 'The work addressed in this paper focuses on the preservation of the conceptual
  model within a specific class of digital objects: Relational Databases. Previously,
  a neutral format was adopted to pursue the goal of platform independence and to
  achieve a standard format in the digital preservation of relational databases, both
  data and structure (logical model). Currently, in this project, we address the preservation
  of relational databases by focusing on the conceptual model of the database, considering
  the database semantics as an portant preservation "property". For the representation
  of this higher layer of abstraction present in databases we use an ontology based
  approach. At this higher abstraction level exists inherent Knowledge associated
  to the database semantics that we tentatively represent using "Web Ontology Language"
  (OWL). We developed a prototype (supported by case study) and define a mapping algorithm
  for the conversion between the database and OWL. The ontology approach is adopted
  to formalize the knowledge associated to the conceptual model of the database and
  also a methodology to create an abstract representation of it.'
