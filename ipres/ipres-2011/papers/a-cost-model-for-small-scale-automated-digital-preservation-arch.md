abstract: Assessing the costs of preserving a digital data collection in the long
  term is a challenging task. The lifecycle costs consist of several cost factors.
  Some of them are difficult to identify and to break down. In this paper we present
  a cost model especially for small scale automated digital preservation software
  system. The cost model allows institutions with limited expertise in data curation
  to assess the costs for preserving their digital data in the long run. It provides
  a simple to use methodology that considers the individual characteristics of different
  settings. The cost model provided detailed formulas to calculate the expenses. The
  model supports the detailed calculation of the expenses for the near future and
  helps to identify the cost trend in the medium and long run (e.g. 5, 10 or 20 years)
  of the archive. The model monetary assesses the userâ€™s work, the purchases of storage
  hardware and other costs of preserving a digital collection. In this paper the first
  version of the model is presented. It includes a discussion about the cost items
  and presents the calculation the costs. A case study shows the application of the
  model for a small business setting.
