abstract: Scholars who study trust in digital archives have largely focused their
  attention on the power of certification by third-party audit as a way to communicate
  trustworthiness to end-users. In doing so, they assume that the establishment of
  a network of trusted digital archives will create a climate of trust. But certification
  at the repository level also assumes the trustworthiness of digital objects within
  a repository; specifically that digital repository objects are authentic and reliable.
  This paper proposes the use of document-level seals of approval as a means of communicating
  to end-users about the trustworthiness of digital objects that is commensurate with
  specific user interaction. Implications of this proposed research stress the importance
  of assessing the ‘real-world’ impact of trust signals on users.
