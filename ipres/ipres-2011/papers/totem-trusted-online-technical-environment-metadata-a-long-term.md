abstract: For emulation and other preservation actions, metadata is needed to describe
  the technical environment (operating system, related software libraries, hardware
  etc.) in which a given file or item of software can be rendered. This paper delineates
  an enhanced entity attribute relationship model suitable as a basis for a database
  (relational, object-relational or object-oriented), or for a RDF ontology. This
  core data model covers the X86, Apple II and Commodore 64 (C64) hardware architectures,
  as well as games consoles. The model is currently instantiated as a MySQL database
  with accompanying API, plus a PHP-based browsing system. Data population, and user
  evaluation are also discussed. The model is extensible over the long term and is
  compatible with OAIS and PREMIS version 2.
