abstract: This article is about the recordkeeping that takes place during large police
  operations in different command post settings, and presents the tentative results
  from a three-year study. The aim is to increase knowledge of the problems related
  to recordkeeping in this kind of environment. Two police operations have been used
  as data sources, one large EU ministerial meeting in Sweden, and one regional disaster
  training exercise. An interpretative case study approach has been applied where
  observation and interviews were the primary data collection techniques. One problem
  is that too much important information is recorded in less permanent ways, on whiteboards
  and on flip charts. Capture, storage, and dissemination of those temporal and analogue
  records are difficult, and reduce the possibility to use records from large operations
  as knowledge reservoirs.
