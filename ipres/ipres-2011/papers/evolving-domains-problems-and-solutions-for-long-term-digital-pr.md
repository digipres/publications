abstract: We present, compare and contrast new directions in long term digital preservation
  as covered by the four large European Community funded research projects that started
  in 2011. The new projects widen the domain of digital preservation from the traditional
  purview of memory institutions preserving documents to include scenarios such as
  health-care, data with direct commercial value, and webbased data. Some of these
  projects consider not only how to preserve the programs needed to interpret the
  data but also how to manage and preserve the related work ows. Considerations such
  as risk analysis and cost estimation are built into some of them, and more than
  one of these efforts is examining the use of cloud-based technologies. All projects
  look into programmatic solutions, while emphasizing different aspects such as data
  collection, scalability, reconfigurability, and full lifecycle management. These
  new directions will make digital preservation applicable to a wider domain of users
  and will give better tools to assist in the process.
