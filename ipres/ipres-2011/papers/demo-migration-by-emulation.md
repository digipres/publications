abstract: 'The availability of migration tools for older formats is often limited.
  Thus we suggest a different approach: using the original applications to access
  the object and transfer the latter into formats which can be accessed in today''s
  environments. The appropriate environment for the digital artefacts could be provided
  through emulation. With the reproduction of the original environment, a large and
  diverse set of migration input/output paths becomes available. Working for the Open
  Planets Project the authors the authors created remotely accessible Web services
  integrated into the PLANETS testbed. These services demonstrate preservation workflows
  using migration together with the emulation of original environments.'
