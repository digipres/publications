abstract: Some of the shared digital artefacts of digital research are executable
  in the sense that they describe an automated process which generates results. One
  example is the computational scientific workflow which is used to conduct automated
  data analysis, predictions and validations. We describe preservation challenges
  of scientific workflows, and suggest a framework to discuss the reproducibility
  of workflow results. We describe curation techniques that can be used to avoid the
  `workflow decay' that occurs when steps of the workflow are vulnerable to external
  change. Our approach makes extensive use of provenance information and also considers
  aggregate structures called Research Objects as a means for promoting workflow preservation.
