abstract: 'Complex visual digital objects and environments present the digital preservation
  community with distinct challenges. Complex visual objects predominantly feature
  interactivity properties, timebased components and intricate interdependencies which
  incorporate composite, heterogeneous, and often bespoke technologies. Work recently
  undertaken in major EC-funded projects has highlighted that continuing progress
  in preserving complex digital materials is achievable through engagement with relevant
  communities and amalgamation of research results and emerging good practices. The
  JISC-funded project Preservation of Complex Objects Symposia (POCOS) addresses these
  issues by creating a template for leading researchers and practitioners to present
  their findings and set out the future directives in this field.

  To this end, POCOS will deliver a series of three symposia focusing on three respective
  areas: Simulations and Visualizations, Software-based Art and Gaming Environments
  and Virtual Worlds. POCOS aims to promote broader appreciation of the state-of-the
  art in preserving complex objects, provide input to collections management and create
  fertile ground for future collaborations between academia and industry.'
