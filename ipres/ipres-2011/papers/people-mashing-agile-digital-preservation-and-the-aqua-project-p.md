abstract: Manual quality assurance (QA) of digitised content is typically fallible
  and can result in collections that are marred by a variety of quality and access
  issues. Poor storage conditions, technology obsolescence and other unforeseen problems
  can also leave digital objects in an unusable state. Detecting, identifying and
  ultimately fixing these issues typically requires costly and time consuming manual
  processes. An inadequate understanding of potential tools and their application
  creates a barrier to the automation and embedding of preservation processes for
  many collection owners. The JISC funded [1] Automating Quality Assurance Project
  (AQuA) [2] applied a variety of existing tools in order to automatically detect
  quality and preservation issues in digital collections and work to bridge the divide
  between technical and collection management expertise. Two AQuA Mashup events brought
  together digital preservation practitioners, collection curators and technical experts
  to present problematic digital collections, articulate requirements for their assessment,
  and then apply tools to automate the detection and identification of the content
  issues. By breaking down the barriers between technical and non-technical practitioners,
  the events enabled grass-roots digital preservation collaboration between the two
  communities. This paper describes the AQuA Projectâ€™s novel approach to agile preservation
  problem solving and discusses the incidental benefits and community building that
  this strategy facilitated.
