abstract: With growing concerns about environmental problems, and an exponential increase
  in computing capabilities over the last decade, the geospatial community has been
  producing increasingly voluminous and diverse geographical datasets. Long-term preservation
  of these geographical data exposed through uniform and interoperable Spatial Data
  Infrastructures (SDIs) is not typically addressed, but highly important for meeting
  legislative requirements, the short and long term exploitation of archived data
  as well as efficiency savings in managing superseded datasets. In this paper, we
  attempt to set out the path and describe what needs to be done now to future-proof
  the investment government agencies around the world have made in digital geographic
  data. We take the INSPIRE SDI as an exemplar to investigate the requirements for
  ensuring sustained access to geographical data from the perspective of a preservation-aware
  and INSPIRE-conformant SDI. We also outline a number of principles for the long
  term retention and preservation of European digital geographic information defined
  by the EuroSDR Geographic Data Archiving working group. In addition, we present
  a preservation profile of the ISO 19115 metadata standard to enable recording and
  exposing important preservation related information about geographical data through
  large-scale SDIs like INSPIRE.
