abstract: One of the most important challenges in planning and maintaining a digital
  repository is to predict the needed resources on a long term basis, especially storage
  size and processing power. The main problem emerges from the need to migrate the
  data at certain times to newer file types, which takes time and alters the needed
  storage space, potentially branching into several migration paths for individual
  objects. Understanding the effect of different policy decisions, such as when to
  migrate or whether to stay within a format family or branching into several format
  families turns into a complex task, specifically when considering non-trivial ingest
  structures and assumptions on format evaluations. In this paper we present ReproSim,
  a framework that simulates the evolution of a digital repository and helps predicting
  these factors. We demonstrate the complexity and power of simulation to assist in
  preservation decisions in a set of scenarios involving different ingest and preservation
  planning profiles.
