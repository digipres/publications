abstract: Scalable systems and services for preserving digital content became important
  technologies with increasing volumes of digitized data. This paper presents a new
  Braille converter service that is a sample implementation of scalable service for
  preserving digital content. The converter service facilitates complex conversion
  problems regarding Braille code. Braille code is a method which allows visually
  impaired people to read and write tactile text. Using a GPU with the CUDA architecture
  allows the creation of a parallel processing service with enhanced scalability.
  The Braille converter is a web service that provides automatic conversion from the
  older BRF to the newer PEF Braille format. This service can manage a large number
  of objects. Speedups on the order of magnitude of 5000 to 6900 (depending on the
  size of the object) were achieved using a GPU (GTX460 graphics card) with respect
  to a CPU implementation. An extension involving an image processing system is used
  for human interaction. Optical pattern recognition allows Braille code creation
  using Braille patterns. No special input device and skills are needed, only familiarity
  with Braille code is required.
