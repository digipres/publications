abstract: 'In partnership with Tessella, FamilySearch is developing an automated approach
  to large scale digitization, ingest and longterm preservation of electronic content.
  The set of proposed processes and underlying architecture must support required
  ingest rates in excess of 20Tb a day.

  Significant effort has been placed on examining the preservation architecture and
  processes for potential bottlenecks. Digital preservation requires computational
  intensive capabilities to provide functionality such as fixity checking, format
  identification and characterization of content. When operating at very large scale
  there is also a real need for a large network bandwidth and high speed storage systems.

  By minimizing the need for human interaction and employing software parallelization
  our initial findings indicate that the primary bottleneck is not processor bound,
  but is directly associated with the movement of digital files into and within the
  application. In short the scalability problem is really a system engineering problem
  and not necessarily an issue for digital preservation per se.'
