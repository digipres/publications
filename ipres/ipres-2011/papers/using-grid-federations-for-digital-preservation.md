abstract: Digital preservation aims at guaranteeing that data or digital objects remain
  authentic and accessible to users over a long period of time, maintaining their
  value. Several communities, like biology, medicine, engineering or physics, manage
  large amounts of scientific information, including large datasets of structured
  data that matters to preserve, so that it can be used in future research. To achieve
  long-term digital preservation, it is required to store digital objects  reliably,
  preventing data loss. The data redundancy strategy is required to be able to successfully
  preserve data. Many of the characteristics required to implement, manage and evolve
  a preservation environment are already present in existing data grid systems, such
  as replication and the possibility to federate with other grids in order to share
  resources. We propose the customization of a data grid platform in order to be able
  to take advantage of its replication and federation features. In that way, scenarios
  where federated grids not thought for preservation purposes can be extended to preservation
  and their spare resources used with that mission.
