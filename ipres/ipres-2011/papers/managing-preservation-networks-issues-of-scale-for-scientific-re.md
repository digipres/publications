abstract: The preservation of science data requires consideration of a wide range
  of factors from file formats to analysis software. Previous work has reported on
  the development of Preservation Network Models that capture dependencies at multiple
  levels and allow reasoning about preservation planning and actions. However this
  is only one aspect of the development of a trusted preservation environment; there
  is also a need for quality assurance and relation to explicit policies on data preservation.
  This paper presents issues of scale for scientific research assets which will be
  explored further on the SCAPE project.
