abstract: 'Emulation is often considered a technically very complex subject. The association
  with complexity has long prevented it from being considered in an end-to-end business
  solution for long-term preservation and access to digital collections.

  The Emulation Framework solves this problem by automating the steps required to
  render an unknown digital object in its original environment: characterising the
  object to determine its type; determining the environment required to render that
  type of object; setting up the required software and emulators providing the hardware;
  and configuring the environment to properly render the digital object. Automating
  these steps allows a novice user to easily render a digital object in an environment
  for accessing it in its original form.

  Each of the four steps of the emulation workflow are described in detail, providing
  a simple tool for managing a complex decision making process.'
