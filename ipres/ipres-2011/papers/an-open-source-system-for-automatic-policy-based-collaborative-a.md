abstract: In this poster, we provide an overview of the SafeArchive system and describe
  how a curator can use the tools to generate an archival policy schema and monitor
  compliance. Also, the poster details the technical implementation of the SafeArchive
  system including the policy schema, how information used in the auditing process
  is obtained from a set of LOCKSS peers without modifying the LOCKSS trust model
  or configuration, and the organization of SafeArchive software components.
