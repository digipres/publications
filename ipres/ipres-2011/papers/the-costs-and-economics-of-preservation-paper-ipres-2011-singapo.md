abstract: Given that preservation is now a fairly well-described problem, it should,
  in theory, be possible to calculate with a reasonable degree of accuracy what costs
  are likely to accrue to an organisation that has responsibility for the long-term
  stewardship of digital assets. This paper will introduce and describe some of the
  work that has been carried out over the last 5 years to help institutions and research
  groups to understand both the cost and the economics of preservation, and to examine
  the difference between those concepts. It will also describe ongoing phases of work
  that are being funded in the UK by JISC that are attempting to further advance understanding
  in this area and where possible apply or implement previously theoretical approaches.
  Some indication will also be given as to where collective international effort may
  be of universal benefit.
