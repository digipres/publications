abstract: The goal of this paper is to examine the extent to which social science
  research data are shared and assess whether sharing is associated positively with
  number of publications resulting from the research data. We construct a database
  from administrative records containing information about thousands of social science
  studies that have been conducted over the last 40 years. Included in the database
  are descriptions of social science data collections funded by the National Science
  Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. Using a subset of these awards,
  we conduct a survey of principal investigators (n=1,021). We find that very few
  social science data collections are preserved and disseminated by an archive or
  institutional repository. Informal sharing of data in the social sciences is much
  more common. The main analysis examines publication metrics that can be tied to
  the research data collected with NSF and NIH funding â€“ total publications, primary
  publications (including PI), and secondary publications (nonresearch team). Multivariate
  models of the count of publications suggest that data sharing, especially sharing
  data through an archive, is associated with many more times the publications compared
  to not sharing data. This finding is robust even when the models are adjusted for
  PI characteristics, grant award features, and institutional characteristics.
