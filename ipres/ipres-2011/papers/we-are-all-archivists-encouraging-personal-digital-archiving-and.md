abstract: The more we interact online and manage digital lives, the more we build
  a born-digital record of our personal contexts and interests. There is a clear mandate
  that libraries, archives and museums must assume responsibility for educating the
  public about strategies for personal digital archiving and personal curation, and
  for exploring new approaches to processing, preservation, and access. Personal digital
  items initially have value to the individuals who generated them, but once those
  items are transferred to a collecting institution they will have a collective value
  to society. We also have a less well-established mandate to work with those citizen
  archivists who are taking the initiative to save large collections of digital ephemera
  and the at-risk output of underserved communities. Large amounts or small, all digital
  materials have the potential to be vital to cultural history studies in the future.
