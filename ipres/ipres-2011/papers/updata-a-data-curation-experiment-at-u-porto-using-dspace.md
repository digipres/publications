abstract: UPData is a scientific data curation experiment currently under development
  at University of Porto which aims to determine the main digital preservation needs
  of several research groups at the university. In the course of the experiment, eight
  datasets have been collected from diverse scientific domains. After conducting several
  interviews with researchers working at U.Porto, we have concluded that from their
  point of view, exible data access is the most valued capability when analysing a
  preservation solution and that offering such access it is the best way to involve
  them in the preservation workflow. We propose an extension to the DSpace repository
  platform to complement it with data curation capabilities. In the proposed solution,
  the system ingests Excel spreadsheets containing scientific data and translates
  them into XML documents which can then be queried via automatically generated XQuery
  statements. Researchers use a search webpage designed for displaying deposited data
  and applying various filters to it, retrieving the parts they need without having
  to scan each file. The collected datasets will be used as test cases for data deposit,
  and also to evaluate the effort required by the curation procedure.
