abstract: Optical disks are widely used in libraries and archives as digital data
  media due to their long-term storage stability. Though archive-grade optical disks
  are already available on the market, there is relative less focus on the reliable
  recording conditions. Commercial DVD-R media were recorded at various recording
  speeds with the maximum speed of 16X, and tested at acceleration aging conditions.
  Through the evaluation of longterm storage features by the data stability test,
  a higher recording speed over 12x resulted in better long-term storage stability.
