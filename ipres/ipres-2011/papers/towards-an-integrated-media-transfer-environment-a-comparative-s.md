abstract: Efficient media transfer is a difficult challenge facing digital preservationists,
  without a centralized service for strategy and tools advice. Issues include creating
  a transfer and ingest system adaptable enough to deal with different hardware and
  software requirements, accessing external registries to help generate accurate and
  appropriate metadata, and dealing with DRM. Each of these is made more difficult
  when dealing with complex digital objects such as computer games or digital art.
  This paper presents the findings of several studies performed within the KEEP project,
  where numerous open-source and commercial media transfer tools have been evaluated
  for their effectiveness in generating image files to be integrated into an emulation-based
  preservation solution for complex digital objects. We provide suggestions for assembling
  toolsets based on the specifications of these tools, therefore providing a valuable
  source of information for media transfer activities.
