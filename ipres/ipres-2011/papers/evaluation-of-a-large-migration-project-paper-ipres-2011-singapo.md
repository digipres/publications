abstract: 'The Danish National Archives (DNA) has ingested structurally heterogeneous
  public digital records since 1973. The year 2004 saw the creation of a new preservation
  standard into which it was decided to migrate the above mentioned archival holdings.
  The main objectives of this operation were to save data from technological obsolescence
  and to reduce the cost of both access and future migrations by streamlining the
  collection. The project costs approximately 30 FSCs (one ‘FSC’— Format and Structure
  Conversion—is the way the project’s project management measured 1 person-year, and
  equals 1,291 person-hours). The total sum of purchasing software, hardware and external
  services amounted to around 135.000 Euros.

  The project migrated data from both relational and hierarchical databases (for instance
  ERDMS and registries), and included the digitisation of audio, video as well as
  paper documentation. The registries counted for example the first Civil Registration
  System from 1968 and the State Tax Administration''s final equation from 1970. Data
  and documentation made up a total of about 1.7 TB, consisted of 11,187 files scattered
  in almost 200 different structures, and constituted more than 2,000 information
  packages (IPs).

  The overall technical objective of the migration was defined by the aforementioned
  preservation standard, which required:

  • Common format for data files

  • Common structure of  documentation, metadata and documents

  • Common format for documents (TIFF).

  The project''s main objectives were achieved, since all records were migrated, except
  the film collection. The goal of making access and future migrations easier was
  also reached, but a fully automatic migration of the collection is not yet entirely
  possible. The overall conclusion is that the migration project, which, to our knowledge,
  is the first of its kind, was of very high quality, both in terms of planning, execution
  and product. A few main conclusions are:

  • Standardisation of data is a prerequisite for an economically sound digital preservation:
  It took about 70 times longer to migrate an older, non-standardised IP, than a newer,
  standardised one.

  • Inadequate feasibility studies remind us that the timing in digital preservation
  saves money: The condition of the magnetic tapes was examined through spot checking
  10 years prior to the migration project and found satisfactory, which turned out
  to be an erroneous, expensive conclusion.

  • The technical infrastructure suffered from a number of shortcomings and late decisions,
  resulting in precious loss of time.'
