abstract: 'Preserving software is widely recognized as a far more complex task then
  preserving static data. Emulation is usually the chosen preservation action to enable
  the execution of programs of obsolete systems. In this work we show how software
  extracted from obsolete media was preserved by developing an emulator. We explain
  the reengineering work involved and the design decisions made as well as the options
  for data injection into and extraction from the emulated environment.

  In previous work, data and programs stored on audio tapes were extracted and the
  resulting audio files were transformed into digital objects. The objects retrieved
  were mainly programs, requiring emulation for execution. As no emulator for the
  original system previously exists, we here show how we implemented one. We first
  describe the system in more detail and explain the reengineering of the view-path
  for the execution of programs on the original system. We show how an existing emulator
  for a video game system was expanded by emulation capabilities for the view-path
  of the home computer and how the different options for data exchange with the host
  environment were implemented on different levels in the view-path. We explain how
  differences in input and output formats and methods influence the development of
  an emulator and that, depending on the original system, the transfer of data between
  the emulated environment and the host environment enforces implicit migration of
  the data to become usable.'
