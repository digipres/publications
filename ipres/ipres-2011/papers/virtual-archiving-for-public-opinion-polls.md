abstract: "The Odum Institute for Research in Social Science Data Archive at the University
  of North Carolina, and partners from the National Network of State Polls present
  progress on a two year demonstration project using the Dataverse Virtual Archiving
  technology [1]. The goal of the Virtual Archiving for Public Opinion Polls: A Demonstration
  Project aims to streamline the ingest process and increase timely submission to
  data archives. Bridging this gap between producers and archives will increase the
  overall submission rates and ultimately preserve many data sets that would otherwise
  be lost.\nAround the world researchers and scientists collect vast amounts of data,
  which often are not archived after the completion of the project or task. As researchers
  move on to new projects, past data they have collected are seldom documented and
  preserved [6]. Until the tools for data curation are integrated into the research
  lifecycle of data, we will continue to experience this problem [2]. This project
  seeks to provide a solution for this problem. Although the virtual archiving technology
  needed to bridge the gap between the data producers and archives already exists,
  the availability of this tool and its value needs to be communicated to the scholarly
  community.\nThe technology we use for this demonstration can be applied to many
  disciplines and data types. In this demonstration, we use public opinion data producers
  because these data serve as a useful, readily recognized example that will be widely
  replicated. Public opinion survey data are the most prevalent single kind of social
  science data and usually what most scientists first encounter.\nThe Odum Institute’s
  relationship with the various state polling agencies and the National Network of
  State Polls make it an ideal candidate to propose new and innovative changes in
  the data life cycle of public opinion polls. This projects builds on our previous
  work with the Dataverse Network (DVN), developed at Harvard University. The Odum
  Institute has been an active partner in the DVN development and has recommended
  system modifications to allow for the maximum flexibility in public opinion preservation,
  distribution, and analysis. The DVN provides the tools necessary to implement this
  change. In this project, we use the DVN technology to aid data producing agencies
  in the ingest, curation and preservation of public opinion data, election polls
  and reports.\nAutomated ingest tools specifically designed for quantitative data
  are used to create metadata automatically on ingest. This is critical for two reasons.
  First, metadata are essential in making data accessible to the scholarly community
  beyond those who were involved in the data collection. Second, the creation of metadata
  — itself a technical field with its own set of tools and norms — is a specialty
  that lies beyond the expertise of most research teams. \nThe project is creating
  customized Web interfaces or “virtual archives” for each of the participating data
  producers. These interfaces are created to allow the researchers to seamlessly upload
  their data. The data will be transparently archived, preserved and curated by an
  organization trained in the field of long-term preservation. Once in the Dataverse
  Network, the data can be discovered and accessed via the existing federated search
  capabilities of the DVN. We are designing new workflows and help train the participating
  data producers to use these new and efficient methods of data ingest."
