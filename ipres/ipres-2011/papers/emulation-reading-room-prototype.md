abstract: The electronic collections of today's libraries, museums and archives are
  growing and increasingly have a more relevant role in the holdings. Memory institutions
  must address users' need to access a widening range of digital artefacts. Often
  the formats of those artefacts are outdated and they cannot be run or rendered on
  today's systems any longer. This is where emulation can provide the required digital
  environments suitable for a given object type. Practical research is being done
  at Freiburg University for the Open Planets Foundation on how to integrate different
  emulators for a number of original environments into a single graphical desktop.
  In this case study, options for future reading room systems like stateless Linux
  workstations are evaluated and prototypical implementations are demonstrated.
