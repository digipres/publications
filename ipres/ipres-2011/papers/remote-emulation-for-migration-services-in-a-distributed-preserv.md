abstract: 'Previous studies have shown the feasibility of migration services when
  using emulation technology. To make rather complex setups of original digital ecosystems
  usable in standard mass migration workflows, a separation of the systems running
  and their interfaces is required. Here remote emulation can become a crucial building
  block of future distributed preservation workflows and access systems.

  In this paper we develop the requirements and a component model for migration-by-emulation
  services in a distributed environment based on division of labour. We suggest a
  modular system which offers interfaces to be accessed by standard preservation frameworks.
  It provides Web services allow access to original system environments via emulation
  engines with additional methods for automated interaction. The proposed migration
  units support versatile migration services and offer a wide range of file conversions
  based on a digital artifacts'' original applications. The component-based architecture
  allows the distribution of system components among specialized memory institutions.'
