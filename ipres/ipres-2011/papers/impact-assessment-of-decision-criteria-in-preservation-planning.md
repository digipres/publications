abstract: Significant progress has been made in clarifying the decision factors to
  consider when choosing preservation actions and the directives governing their deployment.
  The Planets preservation planning approach and the tool Plato have received considerable
  takeup and produce a growing body of knowledge on preservation decisions. However,
  experience sharing is currently complicated by the inherent lack of semantics in
  criteria specification and a lack of tool support. Furthermore, the impact of decision
  criteria and criteria sets on the overall planning decision is often hard to judge,
  and it is unclear what effect a change in the objective evidence underlying an evaluation
  would have on the final decisions. This article presents a quantitative approach
  and tool to support the systematic assessment of criteria and their impact in preservation
  planning. We discuss the reconciliation of different quality models and present
  an analysis tool integrated with the planning tool Plato. We further apply our analysis
  method to a body of real-world case study material and discuss the results. The
  outcomes provide directions to optimise and automate decision-making, watch, and
  policy definitions at large scales, and to lower entry barriers by focussing on
  those aspects that have the strongest impact.
