abstract: In this paper, we describe an innovative approach to the challenges associated
  with managing corporate records in the digital environment. Issues and problems
  with the use of EDRMS are well documented but alternatives are not yet mature enough
  for workplace implementation. The recordkeeping functionality of Microsoft SharePoint
  is disputed by practitioners, but this enterprise content management system appears
  to be emerging as a default solution to manage records. Applying genre theory in
  the configuration of SharePoint will assist records managers in negotiating shared
  understanding with their information technology colleagues which is essential in
  order to achieve digital preservation objectives.
