abstract: In this paper, we describe the context, methods and findings of the Data
  Management Skills Support Initiative (‘DaMSSI’), which supported the five JISC Research
  Data Management Training Materials (‘RDMTrain’) projects of the JISC Managing Research
  Data programme (‘JISCMRD’) in developing discipline-focused postgraduate training
  units in research data management. The Initiative tested the effectiveness of two
  skills frameworks and produced a comparison and synthesis of training approaches
  by the RDMTrain projects. DaMSSI also assisted in the production of a number of
  guidance documents to raise awareness of the importance of data management in career
  development.
