abstract: The last decade has seen a number of reference models and compliance criteria
  for Digital Preservation (DP) emerging. However, there is a lack of coherence and
  integration with standards and frameworks in related fields such as Information
  Systems; Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC); and Organizational Engineering.
  DP needs to take a holistic viewpoint to acommodate the concerns of information
  longevity in the increasingly diverse scenarios in which DP needs to be addressed.
  In addition to compliance criteria, maturity models are needed to support focused
  assessment and targeted process improvement efforts in organizations. To enable
  this holistic perspective, this article discusses the question of capability maturity
  and presents a capability model for DP.We further demonstrate how such an architectural
  approach can be used as a basis to analyze the impact of criteria and metrics from
  the ISO Repository Audit and Certification standard on stakeholders, concerns, drivers,
  goals, and capabilities. The analysis presented here shall contribute to advance
  the understanding of cross-cutting concerns and the dicussion on maturity models
  in DP.
