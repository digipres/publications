abstract: 'The National Library of France is mandated by French law to collect and
  preserve the French Internet. It is now a 10-year old project with collections ranging
  from 1996 to the present. To ensure their long-term preservation, the choice has
  been made to ingest these web archives into the institution’s existing digital preservation
  repository, SPAR (Scalable Preservation and Archiving Repository). There were numerous
  implementation challenges, on the modeling as well as the technical sides, which
  the library met with solutions drawn from international collaboration and widely
  adopted standards, whenever possible.

  – Web archive-specific formats (W/ARC files) lacked validation and characterization
  tools, which led to the development of a Jhove2 module for the ARC format.

  – The heterogeneity of BnF’s web archives in terms of formats, production workflows
  and tools, was managed by aligning all of them on a single model, the current production
  workflow using NetarchiveSuite.

  – The specificities of web archives were matched to the PREMIS data model and dictionary
  and SPAR’s global METS profile.

  – Finally, the need to express technical information about ARC files in a concise,
  manageable fashion led us to define a format-specific metadata scheme for container
  files, containerMD, which will be released to the preservation community (on BnF’s
  website).

  All this development work means new services for digital curators in general and
  preservation experts in particular. They will be able to know their collection better,
  to check its comprehensiveness, and, with that deeper understanding, to investigate
  new preservation strategies. Allowing differentiated service level agreements for
  specific sets of documents, with richer metadata extraction, better quality insurance
  and differentiated preservation strategies, will be the logical next step of the
  web archives long-term preservation project.'
