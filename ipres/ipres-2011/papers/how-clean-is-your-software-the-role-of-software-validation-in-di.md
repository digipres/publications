abstract: The emphasis during the last three EC Framework Programs on Digital Preservation
  (DP) has enhanced our understanding of the boundaries of the problem, produced new
  methods, and supported the construction of preservation tools. In the case of methods
  and tools, measuring their suitability has emerged as a focus of research. What
  evidence does the DP community have that the digital preservation tools perform
  the functions they are supposed to and that they align with original specifications?
  This paper summarizes the efforts of the Sustaining Heritage Access through Multivalent
  ArchiviNg (SHAMAN) project to create and implement software validation as a means
  to gauge the fitness-for-purpose of software outputs. The paper concludes by demonstrating
  the applicability of the validation approach to preservation projects in general.
