abstract: In todayâ€™s literature digital preservation and its concepts are usually
  connoted with long term views on the lifecycle of IT systems and software. In addition
  to that long term view we believe that concepts available for digital preservation
  are also useful in short term views where the life span of systems and software
  is limited to a significantly shorter timeline. In this paper we discuss three different
  real-world use cases that benefit from DP concepts on a short term basis.
