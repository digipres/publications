abstract: To preserve access to digital content, we must preserve the representation
  information that captures the intended interpretation of the data. In particular,
  we must be able to capture performance dependency requirements, i.e. to identify
  the other resources that are required in order for the intended interpretation to
  be constructed successfully. Critically, we must identify the digital objects that
  are only referenced in the source data, but are embedded in the performance, such
  as fonts. This paper describes a new technique for analysing the dynamic dependencies
  of digital media, focussing on analysing the process that underlies the performance,
  rather than parsing and deconstructing the source data. This allows the results
  of format-specific characterisation tools to be verified independently, and facilitates
  the generation of representation information for any digital media format, even
  when no suitable characterisation tool exists.
