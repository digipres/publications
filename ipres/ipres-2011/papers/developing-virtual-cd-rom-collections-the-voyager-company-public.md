abstract: 'Over the past 20 years, many thousands of CD-ROM titles were published;
  many of these have lasting cultural significance, yet present a difficult challenge
  for libraries due to obsolescence of the supporting software and hardware, and the
  consequent decline in the technical knowledge required to support them. The current
  trend appears to be one of abandonment – for example, the Indiana University Libraries
  no longer maintain machines capable of accessing early CD-ROM titles.

  In previous work we proposed an access model based upon networked “virtual collections”
  of CD-ROMs which can enable consortia of libraries to pool the technical expertise
  necessary to provide continued access to such materials for a geographically sparse
  base of patrons who may have limited technical knowledge.

  In this paper we extend this idea to CD-ROMs designed to operate on “classic” Macintosh
  systems with an extensive case study – the catalog of the Voyager Company publications
  which was the first major innovator in interactive CDROMs. The work described includes
  emulator extensions to support obsolete CD formats and to enable networked access
  to the virtual collection.'
