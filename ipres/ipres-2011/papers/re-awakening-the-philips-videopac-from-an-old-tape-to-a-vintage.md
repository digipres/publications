abstract: Preserving data for a specific system usually depends on the system in question.
  Different strategies for different file types are necessary to preserve all data
  for a system. In this demonstration we present tools developed for preserving data
  for a home computer system from 1984. We present how a tool we developed can be
  used to retrieve data stored on audio tapes and how this data is migrated to non-obsolete
  formats. We also present how the data is migrated on a bit-stream level only and
  can then be used in an emulated environment using a recently developed emulator
  for the system's hardware. We further show the features of the emulator that allow
  its proper usage for digital preservation purposes. The purpose of the demo is to
  demonstrate different types of digital objects for a system, the information layers
  of these digital objects and how the proper preservation strategy is chosen. Preserving
  static digital objects and understanding the difference to preserve dynamic and
  interactive digital objects like software is a key preparation for the preservation
  of distributed software as in Software as a Service (SaaS) and even whole business
  processes.
