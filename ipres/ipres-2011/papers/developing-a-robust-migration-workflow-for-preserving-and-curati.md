abstract: 'Many memory institutions hold large collections of hand-held

  media, which can comprise hundreds of terabytes of data spread

  over many thousands of data-carriers. Many of these carriers are

  at risk of significant physical degradation over time, depending on

  their composition. Unfortunately, handling them manually is

  enormously time consuming and so a full and frequent evaluation

  of their condition is extremely expensive. It is, therefore, important to develop
  scalable processes for stabilizing them onto backed-up online storage where they
  can be subject to highquality digital preservation management. This goes hand in
  hand with the need to establish efficient, standardized ways of recording metadata
  and to deal with defective data-carriers. This paper discusses processing approaches,
  workflows, technical set-up, software solutions and touches on staffing needs for
  the stabilization process. We have experimented with different disk copying robots,
  defined our metadata, and addressed storage issues to scale stabilization to the
  vast quantities of digital objects on hand-held data-carriers that need to be preserved.
  Working closely with the content curators, we have been able to build a robust data
  migration workflow and have stabilized over 16 terabytes of data in a scalable and
  economical manner.'
