abstract: 'This paper presents the initial results of the ENSURE (Enabling kNowledge
  Sustainability, Usability and Recovery for Economic value) project, which focuses
  on the challenges associated with the long-term preservation of data produced by
  organisations in the health care, clinical trials and financial sectors. In particular
  the project has looked at the economic implications of long-term preservation for
  business, how to maintain the accessibility and confidentiality of sensitive information
  in a changing environment, and how to detect and respond to such environmental changes.
  The project has developed a prototype system, which is based around a lifecycle
  manager and makes use of ontologies to identify and trigger necessary transformations
  of the data objects in order to ensure their long-term usability. It also uses cloud
  technology for its flexibility, expansibility, and low start-up costs. This paper
  presents one of the use cases: the health care as a way to illustrate some of the
  challenges addressed by the ENSURE system.'
