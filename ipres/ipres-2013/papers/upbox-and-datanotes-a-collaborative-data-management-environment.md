abstract: 'Current research data management workflows are often an a posteriori process,
  with research datasets being targeted for preservation actions after the whole research
  process is completed. This approach works well for research publications but not
  for research datasets due to their dynamic nature. It is important to gather data
  production contexts, so the data management process should be present since the
  start of the research, effectively becoming a part of the workflow. Due to their
  rigid work ow-based deposit approach, widely used repository solutions are not intended
  to support the fast-paced evolution of datasets as they are produced. In this paper,
  we present a collaborative data management environment designed to help a small
  research group store and describe their datasets in preparation for later deposit
  in a data repository. It is built on two integrated, open-source components: UPBox
  - a private cloud and web-based file storage environment - and DataNotes - a solution
  tailored for researchers to collaboratively describe their data, based on Semantic
  MediaWiki. Preliminary usage tests have shown that the features of this solution
  respond to data management needs in research groups.'
