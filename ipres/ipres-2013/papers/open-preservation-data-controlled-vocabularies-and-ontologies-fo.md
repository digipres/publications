abstract: The preservation community is busily building systems for repositories,
  identification and characterisation, analysis and monitoring, planning and other
  key activities, and increasingly, these systems are linked to collaborate more effectively.
  While some standard metadata schemes exist that facilitate interoperability, the
  controlled vocabularies that are actually used are rare and not powerful enough
  for the requirements of emerging scalable preservation ecosystems. This article
  outlines key requirements and elements of such an open ecosystem and discusses the
  starting points for building such a common language. We then present a core set
  of controlled vocabulary elements for preservation quality, objectives, policies,
  and components, and demonstrate how these elements are instantiated to connect preservation
  planning, preservation watch, and experimentation with preservation policies. We
  show how these vocabularies are used to enable automation and enable the preservation
  community to collaborate effectively, and point out extension points and future
  work.
