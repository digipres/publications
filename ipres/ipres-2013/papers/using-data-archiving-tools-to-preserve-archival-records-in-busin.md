abstract: The preservation of archival records from government business systems is
  a pressing concern for archival institutions worldwide. Most business systems developed
  over the last 20 years do not have in-built recordkeeping functionality. Archivists
  and records managers face the task of identifying, extracting and preserving archival
  records from these systems. I use a public authority collection management system
  as a case study to explore how currently available archiving tools might form part
  of a practical method to identify, extract and prepare digital archival records
  for ingestion into a digital preservation archive.
