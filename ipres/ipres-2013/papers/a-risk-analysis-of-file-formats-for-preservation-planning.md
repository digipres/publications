abstract: This paper presents an approach for the automatic estimation of preservation
  risks for _le formats. The main contribution of this work is the definition of risk
  factors with associated severity levels and their automatic computation. Our goal
  is to make use of a solid knowledge base automatically aggregated from linked open
  data repositories as the basis for a risk analysis in the digital preservation domain.
  This method is meant to facilitate decision making with regard to preservation of
  digital content in libraries and archives. We have developed a tool for aggregating
  rich and trusted _le format descriptions. It exploits available linked data resources
  and uses expert models to infer knowledge regarding the long-term preservation of
  digital content. The ontology mapping technique is employed for collecting the information
  from the web of linked data and integrating it in a common representation. Furthermore,
  we employ AI techniques (i.e. expert rules, clustering) for inferring explicit knowledge
  on the nature and preservation-friendliness of the _le formats. A statistical analysis
  of the aggregated information and the qualitative analysis of the aggregated knowledge
  are presented in the evaluation part of the paper. A Web service is created to support
  programmatic access to format and risk analysis reports.
