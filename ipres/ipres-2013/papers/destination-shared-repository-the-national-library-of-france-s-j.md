abstract: The SPAR repository project started as a way to make preservation easier,
  cheaper, and more effective for the National Library of France (Bibliothèque nationale
  de France, BnF). At the time (early 2000s), the BnF used different storage media
  and technologies across the library, and had no unified responsibilities and processes.
  When the decision was made to overhaul the infrastructure and the software to have
  one repository to replace them all, the project designers reflected quite naturally
  that such an effort could and should benefit other libraries that had similar scalability
  issues. There were many obstacles to overcome after that generous impulse. First,
  finding the BnF's niche in the digital preservation landscape, at a time when it
  was growing and evolving fast — as it still is. Even when focusing on the heritage
  sector, there are several other repositories or planned systems that have a national
  vocation, within the archives or higher education communities for instance. Then
  came the matter of combining the needs of the library itself and the design necessities
  of third-party archiving to create a repository that would be scalable, trustworthy
  and open. Last but not least, the BnF is continuously refining the way the repository
  can best serve its clients. The most accessible function for partners is bit-level
  preservation, and any extra step toward comprehensive preservation has to be balanced
  with available resources and tiered prices. As the first clients come in, prices
  and processes are still in flux, and vulnerable to policy changes.
