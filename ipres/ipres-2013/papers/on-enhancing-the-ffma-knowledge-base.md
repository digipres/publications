abstract: Ensuring the long term access to digitized content is a major concern of
  digital libraries. The document migration and summarization are key activities employed
  reach this goal. The evaluation of preservation friendliness and making recommendations
  for long term preservation requires deep domain knowledge which is currently not
  available in any integrated knowledge base. In this paper we present an approach
  for enhancing the automatic aggregated knowledge on computer file formats. A clustering
  algorithm is employed to identify related file formats and to predict missing semantic
  associations between file formats and software tools. This is used to improve the
  discovery of software tools supporting the less popular file formats.
