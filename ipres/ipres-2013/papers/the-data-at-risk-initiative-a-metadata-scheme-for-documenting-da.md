abstract: The Data-At-Risk and Rescue Initiative (DARI), an extension of the international
  CODATA Data-at-Risk Task Group (DARTG), is investigating how to best document data
  rescue efforts. This poster reports on a metadata-driven content analysis, and presents
  a metadata scheme for documenting data rescue. Twenty data rescue projects were
  reviewed for background context, and seven metadata schemes in the areas of preservation
  and data description were analyzed via a content analysis. Version 1.0, Data Rescue
  metadata core, consisting of 13 core elements, is presented, and future directions
  are noted.
