abstract: Emulation as a strategy for digital preservation is about to become an accepted
  technology for memory institutions as a method for coping a large variety of complex
  digital objects. Hence, the demand for ready-made and especially easy-to-use emulation
  services will grow. In order to provide user-friendly emulation services a scalable,
  distributed system model is required to be run on heterogeneous Grid or Cluster
  infrastructure. We propose an Emulation-as-a-Service architecture that simplifies
  access to preserved digital assets allowing end users to interact with the original
  environments running on different emulators. Ready-made emulation components provide
  a flexible web service API allowing for development of individual and tailored digital
  preservation workflows. This paper describes design and implementation of scalable
  emulation services as part of the bwFLA EaaS framework.
