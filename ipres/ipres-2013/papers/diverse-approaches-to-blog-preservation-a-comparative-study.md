abstract: This poster presents highlights of a comparative study of three distinct
  approaches to preserving the content of blogs, to consider the relative benefits
  of each approach in meeting the requirements for blog preservation, in different
  contexts. Assessment criteria are drawn from key publications and frameworks on
  digital preservation as well as practical considerations derived from the authors'
  experience as users and designers of digital archiving tools and systems.
