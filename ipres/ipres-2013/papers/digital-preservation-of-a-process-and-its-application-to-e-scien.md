abstract: 'The increase in computationally intensive science (called e-science) drives
  the need to make scientific processes available for the long term. The current approach
  is often to archive only the resulting publications, and at very most the data sets,
  of scientific experiments, which is insuficient in ex- perimental and data intensive
  science. The preservation of scientific experiments and their results enables others
  to reproduce and verify the results as well as build on the result of earlier work.
  The TIMBUS projects aims at preserving processes for the long term. In this paper
  we present the process framework developed, and apply it to the preservation of
  a Music Classification evaluation process. This classification experiment represents
  a typical information retrieval process for classifying music into predefined categories,
  and evaluating the performance thereof. The paper describes and applies the process
  steps of the three phases of the TIMBUS approach: plan, preserve and redeploy.'
