abstract: Advances in digital preservation software tools have sometimes been slow
  and or poorly directed. The result has been a lack of tools that meet practitioner
  needs, and a surplus of tools that have very few users and little practical application.
  The Jisc funded SPRUCE Project has championed the recording and sharing of practitioner
  requirements, and the development of solutions to meet those requirements using
  agile hackathon or mashup style events. This poster will provide a visual summary
  of requirements identified by practitioners, and will describe four resulting tool
  developments that significantly advance our digital preservation capability.
