abstract: This poster will describe actions being taken in the context of the 4C Project
  (a Collaboration to Clarify the Costs of Curation), an EC-funded two-year coordination
  action that aims to promote a better understanding of the potential for undertaking
  digital curation activity. The approach it is taking is to focus firstly on costs
  but then to link that concept to related ones such as benefits, value, risk and
  sustainability, therefore taking a holistic economic view of digital curation. This
  is important as it links up with various strands of previous work, both on costs
  and activity models; and on benefits, sustainability and the broader economic framework
  for digital preservation and access. The purpose of the poster is to describe the
  novel framework for activity that was proposed in response to the EC FP7-ICT-2011-9
  call, and to summarily describe some of the outputs and objectives in a graphical
  and accessible format.
