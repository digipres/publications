abstract: Preserving processes requires not only the identification of all process
  components, but also the interception of all interactions of the process with the
  external influencers. In order to verify if the collected data is sufficient for
  the purpose of redeployment, as well as to verify that the redeployed process performs
  according to expectations, a framework for verification is needed. This paper presents
  a framework for verification of preserved and redeployed processes. We demonstrate
  the applicability of the framework on an use case from the eScience domain. The
  preservation and the redeployment of the eScience process is tested by migrating
  it to substantially different environments.
