abstract: If a business is in need of customized software it often orders it from
  a third party developer. This can lead to a dependency on this developer regarding
  maintainability and development of the product. Software Escrow o_ers a mitigation
  to this as it includes a trustable escrow agent in the business relationship. The
  agent is responsible for depositing all material that is needed to develop the software,
  like source code, documentation, and licenses for software artifacts. If a prede_ned
  trigger event occurs, the agent is obliged to hand out the objects to the customer.
  Thus the material needs to be of a quality that allows the customer to further maintain
  and develop the software. To guarantee this, all artifacts deposited are veri_ed
  for their maintainability. As this veri_cation is a time consuming and costly factor,
  we propose a Technical Software Escrow Framework that supports the reviewing process
  by highlighting parts of the software that can pose a problem regarding their maintainability.
  We also analyze an exemplary use-case software to show the applicability of our
  framework.
