abstract: Until now, digital preservation research has been mainly driven by public
  or publicly funded organisations. The justification of costs for the preservation
  is based on abstract risks such as the risk of losing cultural heritage information,
  or the risk of data deficien-cies for current and future research in big sets of
  data. Typically, the benefits from digitally preserving the objects of interest
  is difficult or impossible to quantify in terms of return-on-invest. In fact, it
  is common that memory institutions are mandated to pre-serve specific digital objects,
  making digital preservation not an option, but a legal obligation. While in the
  case of cultural herit-age and scientific research qualitative reasons for preservation
  suffice, enterprises have an additional obligation to quantify the expected benefits
  and expenses in order to determine the scope of information to be managed and take
  commercial decisions for or against digital preservation. To provide appropriate
  means for leveraging the benefits of digital preservation in a commercial context,
  we argue in this paper that enterprise risk managers are the established function
  to assess and support decisions about preservation in enterprises. We show that
  enterprise risk manage-ment can be linked to digital preservation and how intelligent
  enterprise risk management can be utilised to identify the need for digital preservation,
  determine the corresponding actions, and contribute to the overall commercial success
  of enterprises.
