abstract: 'From September 3-5, 2013 (with tutorials the September 2 and workshops
  lasting until the September 6), the Instituto Superior Técnico was pleased to host
  the tenth annual iPRES Conference in cooperation with DC-2013, the International
  Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications.

  The conference hosted three keynote presentations. On the first day, Gildas Illien
  of the BNF presented “Darling, We Need to Talk”. On the second day, Paul Bertone,
  from the European Bioinformatics Institute, spoke on the potential of “Digital information
  storage in DNA”. Finally, on the final day, Carlos Morais Pires, from the European
  Commission, presented “Data Infrastructures in Horizon2020: support to data and
  computing intensive science”. Technical sessions at the conference were on central
  preservation topics like web archives, digital object preservation, sharing knowledge,
  repositories, preservation in the corporate world, cooperation, data and beyond
  data, national strategies, assessment, technologies, governance, collections, and
  curation.

  The conference also hosted an exciting poster and demo session that showcased excellent
  early results and software demonstrations. The poster and demo session, along with
  the reception that followed, proved to be an excellent opportunity for academics,
  students, industry representatives and other professionals involved in digital preservation
  to network and share information.'
