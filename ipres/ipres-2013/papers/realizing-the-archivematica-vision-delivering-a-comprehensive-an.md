abstract: Archivematica began in 2008 as a working hypothesis that assumed a comprehensive
  yet free digital preservation system could be created by matching existing open-source
  software tools against the OAIS functional model. Five years later the production
  release of the software is ready to go into production at several major North American
  archives and libraries, while the beta version is already widely-deployed worldwide.
  In the absence of a single major funding sponsor, the project management team worked
  as third-party contractors to several early-implementer institutions that shared
  the project’s architectural and open-source vision while needing to implement an
  effective and sustainable digital curation solution for the digital content entrusted
  to their care. From the outset, Archivematica’s system requirements were based on
  an ongoing dialogue within the digital curation community about the gaps between
  the standards and strategies that were held up as best practice (OAIS, PREMIS, normalization,
  agile development and so forth) and the ability for the average archivists and librarians
  to implement them. The iPres conference has proven to be a critical forum for advancing
  this dialogue and has included papers about the Archivematica micro-services architecture
  [1] and community-driven development approach [2]. This paper will provide a conclusion
  to these earlier papers by discussing the key architectural, digital curation and
  sustainability challenges that the Archivematica project has addressed as it emerged
  from a working prototype to a full-featured digital preservation system. This includes
  system scalability, customization, digital repository interfaces, format policy
  implementation, and a business plan that stays true to the ideals of the free software
  community.
