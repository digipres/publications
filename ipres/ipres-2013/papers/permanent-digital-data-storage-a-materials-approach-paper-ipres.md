abstract: Permanent marks, interpreted as bits, are the sine qua non of deep archival
  storage. Until about 2006, this area of research apparently did not exist, but advances
  in the past several years at Brigham Young University and at Millenniata, Inc.,
  have produced one product (the M-Disc - a permanent recordable optical disc of DVD
  capacity), a follow-on recordable optical disc of Blu-ray capacity, work on multi-layer
  optical discs of Blu-ray capacity on each layer, work on a permanent solid-state
  storage medium, and work on a permanent optical tape storage medium. This paper
  explains the approach used to develop these products and advance the research for
  permanent digital data storage.
