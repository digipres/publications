abstract: Preserving information systems is one of the greatest challenges in digital
  preservation. In this paper we outline the existing strengths and shortcomings of
  a record-centric driven preservation approach for relational databases by lining
  up a state-of-the art industry database archiving tool CHRONOS against SIARD one
  of the most popular products in the GLAM (galleries libraries archives museums)
  world. A functional comparison of both software products in the use cases of database
  retirement, continuous and partial archiving as well as application retirement is
  presented. The work focuses on a technical evaluation of the software products -
  organizational and process aspects of digital preservation are out of scope. We
  explain why preserving complex structures as databases through a record centric
  approach does not only depend on the amount of information captured in the preservation
  package and present a brief overview on available functional aspects in CHRONOS
  that help to address the challenges of application decommissioning. The paper at
  hand presents the results of a case study which was undertaken 2012 at AIT - Austrian
  Institute of Technology GmbH.
