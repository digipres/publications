abstract: 'Rapid changes in the field of technology and exponential increase in the
  volume of digital content makes long-term preservation of institutional resources
  a challenging task. Digital preservation requires a commitment for applying preservation
  actions along with continuous monitoring and management of the preserved resources.
  The expense of these actions mean that a memory institution needs to make choices
  about what level of preservation it can afford to provide for a resource when it
  makes a commitment to preserve it. This paper presents a tiered model to determine
  preservation levels for digital content, based on an assessment that considers three
  factors: type of resource, archival responsibility, and projected preservability
  of the resource (TAP). The paper presents a practical, exible approach to a complex
  set of factors and includes examples of how the model can be applied at an academic
  library.'
