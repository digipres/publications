abstract: In this paper we report the main results of a study on interoperability
  objectives and approaches in digital preservation (DP), conducted within the APARSEN
  Network of Excellence (NoE)1. The aim of the investigation was to collect interoperability
  challenges and goals from various initiatives and project partners and to produce
  a matrix of solutions and guidelines that can guide the stakeholders in DP to the
  multi-dimensional and complex landscape of digital preservation interoperability.
  The paper describes the main findings of the research, including 1) an overview
  of the current projects and initiatives on interoperability in different areas of
  digital preservation, 2) an analysis of the main interoperability scenarios and
  challenges encountered by partners and other stakeholders in their daily life activity
  that served to drive the definition of the main common interoperability objectives
  for digital preservation, 3) a broad matrix of models, standards and services for
  interoperability that cover the main areas of digital preservation, which can be
  used as a working instrument to navigate the complex ecosystem of the current interoperability
  solutions, and 4) a list of recommendations and guidelines to create the ground
  for a coordinated and interoperable digital preservation ecosystem.
