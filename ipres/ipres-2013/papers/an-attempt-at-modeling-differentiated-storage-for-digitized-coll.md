abstract: 'The Koninklijke Bibliotheek (KB) digitizes the national collection of the
  Netherlands. Digitization leads to multiple versions of a publication: a digital
  access file, a digital master file, back-ups of the digital versions and the physical
  original publication. This in turn increases the need for storage capacity quickly.
  And raises questions like: Should all versions be stored? Do all the versions need
  to be preserved in order to ensure permanent access, and if so which ones should
  be preserved and how? Based on the collection care plan and the content strategy
  a differentiated storage policy is set up in order to establish a relation between
  the physical object and the digital counterpart(s). This method assigns value to
  different collection lots and is used to find out how to apply collection care in
  an efficient way.'
