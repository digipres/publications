abstract: This paper discusses the New Zealand Government Digital Archive Programme
  (GDAP) and its requirement for Archives New Zealand to move to a fully functional
  digital preservation system. It looks at the migration of digital content from Fedora
  Commons to Ex Librisâ€Ÿ Rosetta Digital Preservation System focusing on what needed
  to be migrated, preparation of the migration, how it was performed and what tools
  were needed to support the work. We look at the verification of this process and
  conclude with an audit of the results and a description of the lessons learned during
  this process.
