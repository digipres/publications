abstract: Every day, unique valuable information that describes our current days disappears
  from the web. National archives or libraries have been keeping cultural heritage
  for centuries by collecting and preserving past generation objects or printed media.
  Now, it is mandatory to preserve digital cultural heritage in the form of web content.
  The Portuguese Web Archive project began in 2008. Since then, it has periodically
  collected  live-web content to be preserved but also acquired historical web collections
  from third-parties previously published.  However, storing information before it
  vanishes from the web is not enough to make web archives useful to societies. Thus,
  the Portuguese Web Archive developed and made freely available several software
  tools to enable access to web-archived collections. The Portuguese Web Archive provides
  a full-text search service to access 1 131 million files archived from the web since
  1996 (www.archive.pt). It also provides access methods to enable research and development
  activities over web-archived data.
