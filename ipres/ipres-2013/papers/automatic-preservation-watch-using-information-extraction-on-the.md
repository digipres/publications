abstract: The ability to recognize when digital content is becoming endangered is
  essential for maintaining the long-term, continuous and authentic access to digital
  assets. To achieve this ability, knowledge about aspects of the world that might
  hinder the preservation of content is needed. However, the processes of gathering,
  managing and reasoning on knowledge can become manually infeasible when the volume
  and heterogeneity of content increases, multiplying the aspects to monitor. Automation
  of these processes is possible [11, 21], but its usefulness is limited by the data
  it is able to gather. Up to now, automatic digital preservation processes have been
  restricted to knowledge expressed in a machine understandable language, ignoring
  a plethora of data expressed in natural language, such as the DPC Technology Watch
  Reports, which could greatly contribute to the completeness and freshness of data
  about aspects of the world related to digital preservation. This paper presents
  a real case scenario from the National Library of the Netherlands, where the monitoring
  of publishers and journals is needed. This knowledge is mostly represented in natural
  language on Web sites of the publishers and, therefore, is difficult to automatically
  monitor. In this paper, we demonstrate how we use information extraction technologies
  to find and extract machine readable information on publishers and journals for
  ingestion into automatic digital preservation watch tools. We show that the results
  of automatic semantic extraction are a good complement to existing knowledge bases
  on publishers [9, 20], finding newer and more complete data. We demonstrate the
  viability of the approach as an alternative or auxiliary method for automatically
  gathering information on preservation risks in digital content.
