abstract: 'The digital curation and preservation community has long acknowledged that
  trustworthiness is a critical component of successful digital repositories. However,
  there is no known method to determine if or under what circumstances an end-user
  perceives a repository as trustworthy. While the research literature describes definitions,
  criteria, and certification processes that allow repository managers to assert trustworthiness
  under certain conditions, it does not adequately define, measure, or specify trustworthiness
  from the perspective of the end-user. This paper highlights traditional notions
  of trustworthiness in the context of the literature on digital repositories and
  explores trustworthiness from the end-user’s perspective. The paper also presents
  an ongoing research project to: investigate designated communities’ perspectives
  on trustworthiness using focus groups, and explore building, testing, and assessing
  an index to measure trustworthiness.'
