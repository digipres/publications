abstract: Web archiving is crucial to ensure that cultural, scientific and social
  heritage on the web remains accessible and usable over time. A key aspect of the
  web archiving process is optimal data extraction from target websites. This procedure
  is difficult for such reasons as, website complexity, plethora of underlying technologies
  and ultimately the open-ended nature of the web. The purpose of this work is to
  establish the notion of Website Archivability (WA) and to introduce the Credible
  Live Evaluation of Archive Readiness (CLEAR) method to measureWA for any website.
  Website Archivability captures the core aspects of a website crucial in diagnosing
  whether it has the potentiality to be archived with completeness and accuracy. An
  appreciation of the archivability of a web site should provide archivists with a
  valuable tool when assessing the possibilities of archiving material and influence
  web design professionals to consider the implications of their design decisions
  on the likelihood could be archived. A prototype application, archiveready.com,
  has been established to demonstrate the viability of the proposed method for assessing
  Website Archivability
