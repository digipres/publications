abstract: In this paper we present ongoing work conducted as part of the BitCurator
  project to develop reusable, extensible strategies for transforming and incorporating
  metadata produced by digital forensics tools into archival metadata schemas. We
  focus on the metadata produced by open-source tools that support Digital Forensics
  XML (DFXML), and we describe how portions of this metadata can be used when recording
  PREMIS events to describe activities relevant to preservation and access. We examine
  open issues associated with these transformations and suggest scenarios in which
  capturing forensic metadata can support digital curation goals by establishing clear
  documentation of integrity and provenance, tracking events associated with pre-ingest
  and post-ingest forensic processing, and providing specific evidence of authenticity.
