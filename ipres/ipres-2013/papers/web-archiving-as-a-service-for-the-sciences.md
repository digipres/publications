abstract: The collection and archiving of scientifically relevant websites is so far
  a vastly neglected sphere of activity in German libraries. To counteract this looming
  loss and providing researchers with permanent access to websites, the Bavarian State
  Library (BSB) has built up a web archiving workflow already more than two years
  ago. The main goal of a project newly approved by the German Research Foundation
  (DFG) is the development and implementation of a cooperative service model. This
  service will support other cultural heritage institutions in their web archiving
  activities and facilitate the build up of a distributed German scientific web archive.
  With this project the Bavarian State Library wants to improve both quantity and
  quality of scientific web archives and promote their use in the scholarly context.
