abstract: The Chronicles in Preservation project, being led by the Educopia Institute,
  is undertaking research to evaluate the degree to which several of the current digital
  preservation standards in use today (e.g., OAIS, TRAC, PREMIS,METS, etc.) can be
  applied to the diverse and at-risk content genre of digital newspapers. Institutions
  need guidance on incremental, skilled approaches and lightweight tools and resources
  if they are going to begin caring for such content in achievable and yet sustainable
  ways. The Chronicles project has researched, experimented, and begun advocating
  for a variety of skills, tools, and other resources that both embrace the current
  standards and seek to implement them in lightweight ways. They incorporate, apply
  and extend a number of existing as well as leading edge advancements such as BagIt,
  the DAITSS Description Service, UNT's PREMIS Event Service, and the NDSA Levels
  of Preservation.
