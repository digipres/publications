abstract: The change of status of data files from mere stepping stones to build other
  research products into publishable documents raises the question of how to organize
  data repositories appropriate for dissemination of such publications outside of
  the original research group. If the repository is to be used for the on-going research
  by the research group, it assumes the role of a digital archive. In this paper,
  a metadata model for the special case of projects relying on monitoring data is
  proposed and a prototype digital archive is described that has been built according
  to that model. This metadata is critical to preserve the context of production of
  the data at the organizational and technical levels and the meaning of each value.
  The digital archive offers several services for ingestion, visualization and dissemination
  that are essential for the effective adoption of the system. The method followed
  has been focus group work with a research group on structural health monitoring
  during the metadata specification phase, and an iterative development approach during
  the prototype construction phase of a digital archive for the same group.
