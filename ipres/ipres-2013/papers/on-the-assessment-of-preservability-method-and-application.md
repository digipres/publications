abstract: This paper aims to establish engineering processes and methods for the assessment
  and deployment of digitally preservable systems by identifying a method for assessing
  the preservability capabilities of systems. The work done on this was based on the
  hypothesis that preservability consists of a set of systems capabilities that originates
  from a combination of system/software capabilities as defined in ISO 25010:2010.
  Based on that hypothesis, it was verified that such quality characteristics influence
  the preservability of systems. That influence is relative, since it depends on the
  specific scenario being addressed and on the concerns and requirements of the stakeholders
  of the system, as different qualities of a system might assume different degrees
  of importance along time. With those principles taken into account, this work developed
  an assessment method for assessing the preservability of systems that can be adapted
  to each scenario being analyzed. For demonstrating the application of the method,
  an example assessment was performed on a specific scenario, which resulted on the
  revelation that preservability of the system in focus on that particular case can
  be greatly improved.
