abstract: In human memory, forgetting plays a crucial role for focusing on important
  things and neglecting irrelevant details. In digital memories, the idea of systematic
  forgetting has found little attention, so far. At first glance, forgetting seems
  to contradict the purpose of archival and preservation. However, we are currently
  facing a tremendous growth in volumes of digital content. Thus, it becomes ever
  more important to focus, while forgetting irrelevant details, redundancies and noise.
  This holds true for better organizing the information space as well as in preservation
  management for making and revisiting decisions on what to keep. Therefore, we propose
  the introduction of the concept of managed forgetting as part of a joint information
  management and preservation management process in digital memories. Managed forgetting
  models resource selection as a function of attention and significance dynamics.
  Based on dynamic, multidimensional information value assessment it identifies information
  objects, e.g., documents or images of decreasing importance and/or topicality and
  triggers forgetting actions. Those actions include a variety of options, namely,
  aggregation and summarization, revised search and ranking behavior, elimination
  of redundancy, and finally, also deletion. In this paper, we present our vision
  for managed forgetting, discuss the challenges as well as our first ideas for its
  introduction, and present a case study for its motivation.
