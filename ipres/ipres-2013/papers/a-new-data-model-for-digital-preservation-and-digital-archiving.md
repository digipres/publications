abstract: The three ministries in charge of public digital archiving in France (Culture,
  Defence and Foreign Affairs) decided to build a specific system in order to preserve
  their digital information. The main challenge is the management of all the data
  and metadata produced by the French State which could be linked to Big data technologies.
  Since February 2013, these three ministries have done a large experiment (a proof
  of concept) based on NoSQL technologies, which ended in June 2013. In this paper,
  we describe our IT approach of this archivistic problem, our new data model and
  the results of this inter-ministerial study.
