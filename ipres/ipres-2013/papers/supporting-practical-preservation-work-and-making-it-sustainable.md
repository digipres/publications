abstract: The SPRUCE Project has applied community oriented approaches to support
  and sustain digital preservation activity. An emphasis on practitioner requirements
  and focused agile development has enabled the updating and refinement of key digital
  preservation toolsets that meet user needs. The capture and sharing of these requirements
  has provided a detailed snapshot of current curation practice, providing insight
  into practical practitioner needs for those able to fund and support tool and service
  development. A variety of collaborative initiatives have developed online resources
  and forums for supporting digital preservation activity. SPRUCE has begun constructing
  a toolset to support managers and practitioners in making the case to fund and sustain
  digital preservation activity. As SPRUCE enters its final half year, this paper
  provides an outline of key achievements as well as thoughts on the effectiveness
  (or otherwise) of some of the more innovative or unconventional approaches taken
  by the Project.
