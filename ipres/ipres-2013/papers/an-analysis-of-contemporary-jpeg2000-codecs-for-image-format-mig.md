abstract: 'Despite the importance of web archives for the access to historical information
  published on the Internet, human interaction with web archives systems has not been
  thoroughly addressed. The web archive search user interface presented on this paper
  was derived from several rounds of development and usability testing over the Portuguese
  Web Archive search user interface (available at archive.pt). We present our findings
  gathered while adapting a typical web search user interface to the context of web
  archive search.  We describe how we adapted a typical search user interface to address
  full-text and URL search over web-archived data, highlighting the unexpected problems
  detected during us- ability testing of our interface and current limitations for
  future work. The obtained results from usability testing showed that the average
  user satisfaction with our user in- terface was 70%. The obtained results from anonymous
  user satisfaction questionnaires yield a 84.3% score. This paper presents results
  of an analysis of different implementations of the JPEG2000 standard, specifically
  part 1: JP2, an image format that is currently popular within the digital preservation
  community. In particular we are interested in the effect different JPEG2000 codecs
  (encoders and decoders) have on image quality in response to lossy compression.
  We focus on three main codec libraries for analysis - Kakadu, JasPer and OpenJPEG
  - migrating 932 TIFF newspaper images to lossy JPEG2000 files using 2:1 and 4:1
  compression ratios, and monitor image quality using PSNR. We look at the combination
  of encoder/decoder pairs and find that using OpenJPEG for both gives the best quality
  results, albeit with the slowest execution time. We also find that in some circumstances,
  particularly when a JasPer encoder is used, in order to retain image quality of
  the decoded image, the best choice of decoder may not be the same codec used to
  create the JPEG2000; based on these results, the encoding library is therefore recommended
  technical preservation metadata to retain.'
