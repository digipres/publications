abstract: 'This paper introduces datorium - a digital data preservation project at
  the Data Archive of GESIS-Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences. datorium is
  a new data repository service for the research community. It functions as a web-based
  data sharing repository providing a user-friendly tool for researchers making data
  accessible for the purpose of re-use by other scholars. Sharing, managing, documenting
  and publishing data, structured metadata and publications will be carried out autonomously
  by researchers. Data and related information will be available free of charge. All
  uploaded research data and documentation will be peer-reviewed and digitally preserved
  by the GESIS Data Archive.

  GESIS promotes data sharing as a scholarly ideal and facilitates cooperation between
  researchers. By developing datorium the Data Archive aims to collect and provide
  research data with a wide thematic scope for academic re-use. A further intention
  is to ensure long-term preservation of archived data and metadata as well as providing
  wide-ranging dissemination possibilities for scholars in order to increase the visibility
  and availability of their research projects. By providing access to their research
  data scholars can support new research or secondary analysis and beyond that they
  profit from increased citations of their work, thereby improving their professional
  reputation.'
