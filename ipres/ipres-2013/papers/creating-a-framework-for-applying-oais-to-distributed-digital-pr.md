abstract: This paper describes work being done towards a Framework for Applying the
  Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS) to Distributed Digital
  Preservation (DDP). Such a Framework will be helpful for future analyses and/or
  audits of repositories that are performing digital preservation in highly distributed
  ways. A great deal of work has already been accomplished toward the Framework itself,
  including selective community reviews of a white paper, case study interviews with
  DDP practitioners, and an analysis of OAIS as it relates to DDP. The paper will
  provide background information on this set of work, describe the research carried
  out to-date, and explain the proposed Framework components, including concepts and
  terminology, placement of OAIS functional entities, and roles and responsibilities
  for carrying out DDP.
