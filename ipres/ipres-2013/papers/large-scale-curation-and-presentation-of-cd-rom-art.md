abstract: For memory institutions both preservation and presentation of digital art
  is especially challenging. The digital toolset available to artists is almost infinite
  as well as their creativity using technology in unconventional ways. In contrast
  to other sources of digital artifacts with sector-wide quasi-standards on digital
  formats, each artwork presents a challenge of its own. Hence, each object need individual
  examination and preparation in order to preserve it in a useful way. In this paper
  we present workflows and tools for emulationbased preservation and presentation
  of digital art by the example of a collection of CD-ROM art. Furthermore, we evaluate
  the performance results of an emulation-based approach.
