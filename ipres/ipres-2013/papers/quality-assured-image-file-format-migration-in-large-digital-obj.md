abstract: This article gives an overview on how different components developed by
  the SCAPE project are intended to be used in composite file format migration workflows;
  it will explain how the SCAPE platform can be employed to make sure that the workflows
  can be used to migrate very large image collections and in which way the integration
  with a digital object repository is intended. Two institutional image data migration
  scenarios are used to describe how the composite workflows could be applied in production
  library environments. The first one is related to the British Newspapers 1620-1900
  project at the British Library which produced around 2 million images of newspaper
  pages in TIFF format. The second is a large digital book collection hosted by the
  Austrian National Library where the book page images are stored as JPEG2000 image
  files.
