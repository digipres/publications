abstract: The emergence of the European Digital Library (Europeana) foregrounds the
  need for aggregating content using smarter and more efficient ways taking into account
  its context and production circumstances. This paper presents the main functionalities
  of MoRe, a curation oriented aggregator that addresses digital preservation issues.
  MoRe combines aggregation, digital curation and preservation capabilities in a package
  that shields content providers from changes, and that ensures efficient, high volume
  metadata processing. It aggregates data from a wide community of archaeological
  content providers and integrates them to a common metadata schema. The system provides
  added-value digital curation services for metadata quality monitoring and enrichment
  so that to ensure metadata reliability. Furthermore it provides preservation workflows
  which guarantee effective record keeping of all transactions and the current status
  of the repository.
