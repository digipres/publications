abstract: The preservation of epidemiological information is challenging in several
  aspects, since this is both a data-intensive and multidisciplinary subject, with
  large amounts of data spanning several domains of knowledge. We present, as a case
  study, the Epidemic Marketplace (EM), a platform dedicated to the preservation of
  epidemiological resources. To ensure integrity of the data, the EM uses a metadata
  model coupled with the Network of Epidemiology-Related Ontologies (NERO), a compilation
  of ontologies covering several domains of epidemiology. This enables users to quickly
  annotate their resources with concepts from those ontologies, increasing their visibility.
  Additionally, the ontologies of NERO offer support for future development, guaranteeing
  longevity of the metadata. This ensures that the information about the resources,
  such as its authors, is preserved and can be searched even in the absence of the
  data itself.
