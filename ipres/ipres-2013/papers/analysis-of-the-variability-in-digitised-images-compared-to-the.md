abstract: The paper evaluates the noise which is present in digitised images of very
  high quality and the noise/error which results when such images are compressed and
  then decompressed. The variations between pairs of captured images of identical
  material were compared and the two best pairs of images were identified. The variations
  between these pairs were then compared with the variations introduced by compression
  and decompression of those images. We found that even lossy compression can result
  in significantly lower variation than that between the best pairs of original images
  caused by imaging noise. We report the results of a qualitative questionnaire which
  are in good agreement with the quantitative assessment. The conclusions suggest
  that given the extent of noise in the imaging process the current practice of storing
  lossless master digitised images could be replaced by the use of more compact compressed
  images, arguably with no loss of quality.
