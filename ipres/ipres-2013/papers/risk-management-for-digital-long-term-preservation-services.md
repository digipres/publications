abstract: This article presents an ingest level system which has been developed as
  part of the Digital Preservation for Libraries (DP4lib) project. The purpose of
  the system and its implementation is to facilitate automatic technical quality checking
  of digital materials. It represents an essential part of the risk management system
  within the long-term preservation processes of the German National Library (DNB).
  Initial practical experience is reported upon, demonstrating that a significant
  step has been taken towards ensuring the long-term usability of digital materials.
