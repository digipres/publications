abstract: Increasingly, content owners are operating repositories with large, heterogeneous
  collections. The responsibility to provide access to these collections on the long
  term requires preservation processes such as planning, monitoring, and actual preservation
  operations such as migration and quality assurance, which have to be managed and
  integrated with the repositories. This article presents a suite of systems designed
  to support the preservation lifecycle in repositories. The SCAPE Planning and Watch
  suite provides the framework and toolset for controlling and monitoring scalable
  preservation operations. We present the main components for content profiling, preservation
  planning, and monitoring, and show how they can be combined to support scalable
  management of preservation over time.
