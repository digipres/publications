abstract: The BBC Archive now contains around 15 Petabytes (single copy) of uncompressed
  audio-visual files that have been created from videotapes since 2007. This process
  is still on-going, creating an ever growing file-based collection of the BBC's television
  history. This is of course in addition to the new content now being produced that
  begins life as files. This paper focuses on the technology aspects of the digital
  preservation of the file-based historical TV collection and looks at how this currently
  isolated collection may later interface with other systems and collections. Consideration
  is given to what has been achieved so far, some lessons learnt, and the future challenges.
