abstract: The National Digital Library of Finland is an entity, which aims to create
  a nationally unified structure for contents and services ensuring the effective
  and high-quality management, dissemination, and especially digital preservation
  of cultural digital information resources. The National Digital Libraryâ€™s basis
  is formed by libraries, archives and museums (partner organizations). Because of
  the diversity of the partner organizations, the digital content to be preserved
  makes up a very heterogeneous landscape. To find out preparedness of partner organization
  to join common digital preservation system, we established ten different pilots
  of preparing and ingesting submission information packages with common specifications.
  These specifications define technical requirements for the digital objects, their
  metadata, and package structure to be submitted for digital preservation. In this
  paper, we show the piloting process, the experiences and the results, believing
  that these findings might be useful for various organizations involved with digital
  preservation.
