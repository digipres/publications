abstract: "The 4C Project is tasked with delivering a Roadmap report and it is this
  drive towards ‘economic efficiency’ in relation to digital curation that will be
  central to the agenda that it sets out. This workshop is an important opportunity
  to connect with stakeholders and get input for a critical deliverable of the project.
  But it is also an opportunity for participants to learn more about the economics
  of digital curation and to critically assess the efficiency and sustainability of
  their own services and solutions. \n\n "
