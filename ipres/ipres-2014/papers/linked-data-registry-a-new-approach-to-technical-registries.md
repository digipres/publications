abstract: 'Technical Registries are used in digital preservation to enable

  organizations to maintain definitions of the formats, format

  properties, software, migration pathways etc. needed to preserve

  content over the long term. There have been a number of

  initiatives to produce technical registries leading to the

  development of, for example, PRONOM, UDFR and the Planets

  Core Registry.


  However, these have all been subject to some criticisms. One

  problem is that either the information model is fixed and difficult

  to evolve or flexible but hard for users to understand. However,

  the main problem is the governance of the information in the

  registry. This has often been restricted to the host organization,

  which may have limitations on the investment they can make.

  This restriction has meant that, whilst other organizations have,

  perhaps, been free to use the registry they have been unable to

  add to or edit the information within it. The hosts of the

  registries have generally been receptive to requests for additions

  and change but this has still led to issues with timing or when

  different organizations cannot agree (or just utilize or interpret

  things in different ways).


  In this paper we describe a new approach, which has used linked

  data technology to create the Linked Data Registry (LDR). This

  approach means it is simple to extend the data model and to link

  to other sources that provide a more rounded description of an

  entity. In addition, every effort has been made to ensure there is

  a simple user interface so that users can easily find and

  understand the information contained in the registry.


  This paper describes what is believed to be the first linked data

  technical registry that can be deployed widely. The key element

  of the new approach is the distributed maintenance model which

  is designed to resolve the governance problem. Any organization hosting an LDR instance
  is free to add and edit content and to

  extend the model. If an instance of LDR is exposed on the

  internet, then any other organization is free to retrieve this

  additional information and hold it in its own LDR instance,

  alongside locally maintained information and information

  retrieved from other sources. This means a peer-to-peer network

  is established where each registry instance in the network

  chooses which other registry instances to trust and thereby from

  whom to receive which content. This gives control to each

  individual organization, since they are not dependent on anyone

  else but can choose to take different content from appropriate

  authoritative sources. At the same time it allows collaboration to

  reduce the administrative burden associated with the

  maintenance of all of the information.'
