abstract: "This tutorial will prepare participants to use the open-source BitCurator
  environment to acquire and process born-digital data. There will be a brief lecture
  and discussion that focuses on the motivation for using the tools and several foundational
  technical concepts. The remainder of the tutorial will be devoted to demonstration
  and hands-on exercises that demonstrate specific tools and methods. Participants
  will learn how to mount media as read-only, create disk images, mount forensically
  packaged disk images, export individual files or entire directories from disk images,
  use Nautilus scripts to perform batch activities, generate and interpret Digital
  Forensics XML (DFXML), generate a variety of standard and customized reports (including
  PREMIS records), and identify various forms of sensitive data within collections.
