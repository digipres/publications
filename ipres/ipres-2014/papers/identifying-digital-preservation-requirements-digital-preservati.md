abstract: 'The British Library is increasingly a digital library. Over past decades,
  it has built up significant collections of digital content covering a very wide
  range of content types. In addition to the increasing amounts of digital content
  acquired by purchase or donation, the Library and its partners have also invested
  heavily in the digitization of selected collection content, helping to create large
  collections of certain types of content (e.g., newspapers, outof-copyright books,
  and sound). Most recently, the extension of legal deposit provisions to non-print
  works in 2013 has meant that the British Library - working in conjunction with the
  other UK legal deposit libraries - has begun to collect new categories of digital
  content, including periodic harvests of the UK Web domain. In order to support this,
  the Library has also invested heavily in developing scalable infrastructures for
  the acquisition, storage and management of large amounts of digital content. The
  British Library Digital Preservation Strategy, 2013-2016 is focused on the embedding
  of digital sustainability as an organizational principle across the Library and
  to help manage preservation risks and challenges across all digital collection content
  lifecycles. This practice paper describes work being undertaken by the Digital Preservation
  Team at the British Library to develop content profiles of high-level digital collections
  that will support the implementation of the strategy, in particular for the capture
  of long-term preservation requirements. '
