abstract: 'Organisations with a commitment to long-term digital preservation need
  to be perceived as trustworthy to meet the demands of their stakeholders. Audit
  and certification procedures provide a means to transparency and trustworthiness.
  The State and University Library has worked with trustworthiness for several years
  using different tools. In this paper, we describe the process and the benefits of
  performing an audit based on self-assessment by the use of ISO 16363 on the digital
  repository of the State and University Library. After describing the digital collections,
  DP organisation, policy framework and repository infrastructure it is explained
  how The State and University Library has been working with trustworthiness over
  the last four to five years. The latter part of the paper describes how we have
  conducted a self-assessment of the digital repository by the means of the ISO standard
  16363. We explain some of the challenges of the work and the immediate effects of
  the process, which, at the time of writing, is not finished yet. '
