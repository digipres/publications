abstract: "It has been shown that data management should start as early as possible
  in the research workflow to minimize the risks of data loss. Given the large numbers
  of datasets produced every day, curators may be unable to describe them all, so
  researchers should take an active part in the process. However, since they are not
  data management experts, they must be provided with user-friendly but powerful tools
  to capture the context information necessary for others to interpret and reuse their
  datasets. In this paper, we present Dendro, a fully ontology-based collaborative
  platform for research data management. Its graph data model innovates in the sense
  that it allows domain-specific lightweight ontologies to be used in resource description,
  acting as a staging area for later deposit in long-term preservation solutions.
