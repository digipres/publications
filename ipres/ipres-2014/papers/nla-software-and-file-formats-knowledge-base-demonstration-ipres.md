abstract: This demonstration will showcase ongoing work at the National Library of
  Australia to develop a software and file formats knowledge base for digital preservation
  purposes. This project involves empirical research into the capabilities of software
  applications in relation to file formats. We will talk about the types of information
  we capture in the knowledge base and describe the steps we are taking to transform
  it into a machine-actionable graph database, a prototype of which will also be demonstrated.
