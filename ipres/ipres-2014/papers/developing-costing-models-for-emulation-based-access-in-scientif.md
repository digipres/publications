abstract: Digital preservation practitioners are beginning to answer questions about
  the costs related to the long-term availability of digital information. In order
  to successfully model these costs archival systems and workflows need to be fully
  understood and their costs identified. This can become exceedingly difficult for
  complex access and preservation strategies like emulation. If emulation is to be
  considered in a strategy mix its cost components need to be gathered and understood
  so that institutions can develop informed preservation plans and decide which strategy
  to follow. The digital preservation community now has a systematic understanding
  of storage and repository administration costs, but emulation and surrounding services
  are still an emerging topic for memory institutions. While costs to produce bitpreservable
  representations of digital artefacts are relatively well known there is an array
  of rather unpredictable cost factors that need to be further researched. Many of
  these unexplored costs factors vary depending on the kind of digital objects and
  the objectives of the stakeholders involved in the activities.
