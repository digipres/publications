abstract: This demonstration proposal describes the Curation Cost Exchange platform
  (CCEx), a web application that allows organizations to introduce, analyse, share
  and compare the cost of their digital curation activities. It is also a central
  hub for digital curation costing related information; and is a social platform that
  brings together organizations with the same problems and allows sharing of experiences,
  good practices and know-how. The CCEx is an output of the 4C Project (a Collaboration
  Clarify the Costs of Curation) and the relationship of the CCEx to other 4C Project
  outputs will also be briefly described.
