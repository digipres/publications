abstract: 'Archive authorities develop information resources to enable public offices
  to meet their obligations under their jurisdiction''s public records laws. Particular
  care is taken to ensure that these materials equip their audience with the necessary
  context and knowledge. Our current work with the evaluation of tools and processes
  for the preservation of relational databases causes us to question whether good
  documentation will be enough.


  In this paper we describe our experiences at the Public Record

  Office Victoria (PROV), Australia, in developing processes and guidance for the
  preservation of relational databases. We find that these projects are different
  to ‘traditional’ transfers, and that their novelty and technical challenges may
  be made more difficult by organizational and conceptual complexities. We posit that
  the nature of such projects may require more than the knowledge of that must be
  done and how it should be done. We reason that these projects may be hindered by
  the lack of a shared language to communicate across organisational or functional
  boundaries.


  Using database preservation projects as an example, we discuss the potential contribution
  that theoretical perspectives such as boundary objects (Star), transmission theory
  (Shannon) and externalization (Norman) may make to our development of guidance and
  how this may assist the support of cross-functional dialogue. While focused on database
  preservation projects, this approach may be generalisable to other cross-disciplinary
  and cross-functional work.'
