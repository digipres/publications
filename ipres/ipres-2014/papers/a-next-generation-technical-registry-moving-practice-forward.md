abstract: 'In this paper we introduce the work of the National and State

  Libraries Australasia Digital Preservation Technical Registry

  project.


  Digital preservation practitioners must be able to assume technical and intellectual
  control of content they are charged with preserving. Our experiences tell us that
  the information and services used to underpin this control are insufficient. Enterprise-class
  digital preservation services require something better. We believe the solution
  outlined here is well placed to deliver information required to preserve digital
  content. Ultimately, this means that the practitioner can say with a strong degree
  of certainty that they do indeed have control of the content they are charged with
  preserving. '
