abstract: 'Much digital preservation research has been built on the assumption that
  file format obsolescence poses a great risk to the continued access of digital content.
  In efforts to address this, a number of researchers created lists of factors that
  could be used to assess risks associated with digital file formats. This research
  examines these assumptions about file format obsolescence and file format evaluation
  factors with the aim of creating a simplified file format endangerment index.


  This study examines file format risk under a new lens of file format endangerment.
  Using the Delphi method in two separate studies, this exploratory research collected
  expert opinion on relevance of a list of factors as causal indicators of file format
  endangerment.


  The findings show that only three of the dozens of file format evaluation factors
  discussed in the literature exceeded an emergent threshold level as causes of file
  format endangerment: rendering software available, specifications available, and
  community/3rd party support. These factors are ideal candidates for use in a file
  format endangerment index. '
