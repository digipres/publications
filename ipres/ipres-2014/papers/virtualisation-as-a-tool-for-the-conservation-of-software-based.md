abstract: 'Tate has a small but growing collection of software-based artworks. From
  the outset basic preservation procedures, like testing equipment, backing up hard-drives
  and assets or thoroughly documenting the hardware and software were put in place,
  but it was clear that these procedures would need revising over time and as our
  experience grew. Tate’s earliest softwarebased artwork was created in 2003 and after
  10 years the issues around aging technologies are becoming more obvious and new
  strategies for preservation are more urgently needed. The number of artworks being
  acquired and displayed is increasing and therefore better workflows must be developed
  to accommodate this increase.


  This paper describes a short project to scope the use of virtualisation for preserving
  software-based artworks in Tate’s Collection. It briefly explains the tests performed,
  in terms of the techniques, resources and expertise involved. Through the tests
  it was confirmed that virtualisation is a viable strategy for the preservation of
  software-based artworks, and that it meets our requirement that the artworks be
  stored as a complete system independent from the original hardware. It was also
  a main requirement that different virtualisation tools must support the resulting
  virtual machines. As a conclusion, the workflow currently being developed for the
  preservation of Tate’s softwarebased artworks will be outlined.'
