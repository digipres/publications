abstract: 'In this paper, the authors describe the work done within the NSLA Digital
  Preservation Group to create a list and description of the functional components
  of an ideal digital preservation environment and a matrix of the current stage of
  development against each component for each NSLA library. After defining underlying
  assumptions, the functional components were derived from the OAIS standard. A modified
  Capability Maturity Model was incorporated as a mechanism for determining each organisation’s
  stage of development against each component. The matrix was then completed by representatives
  from the Digital Preservation Group in each of the ten NSLA libraries. The respondents
  were asked to self-rate their organisations for both the current digital preservation
  situation, and an intended situation in three years’ time. NSLA has identified digital
  preservation as an area of priority. The results from the Digital Preservation Environment
  Maturity Matrix reveal that NSLA libraries are on the right path but have some way
  to go before digital preservation processes are mature, sustainable and fit for
  purpose. Collaboration on policies, products and infrastructure will continue to
  address these needs.  '
