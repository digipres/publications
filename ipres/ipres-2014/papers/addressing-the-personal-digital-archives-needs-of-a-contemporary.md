abstract: 'The study of personal digital archives is an emerging research area that
  crosses multiple domains including digital preservation, personal information management,
  archives, and recordkeeping. The practical need and desire for solutions and tools
  to meet the long-term preservation and access needs of individuals is increasing
  in relation to the ubiquitous production of digital information in contemporary
  society. To date, most digital preservation research has focused on the development
  of methods, tools, and solutions for institutional contexts such as libraries, archives,
  and other types of repositories. The personal context of an individual is distinct
  from organizational or institutional contexts, and necessitates new methods and
  approaches to better understand and develop solutions to meet personal digital recordkeeping
  and preservation needs. This paper describes a research project in progress that
  is focusing on this personal context by utilizing a case study approach to explore
  the design, development and implementation of personal digital recordkeeping system
  for a specific type of individual: a contemporary artist.'
