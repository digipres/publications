abstract: 'This workshop introduces the work of the National and State Libraries funded
  work on a Digital Preservation Technical Registry. In particular it will allow participants
  to gain an understanding of the new model for modelling formats. They will be tasked
  with working through exercises designed not only to give participants an understanding
  of the model, but to test and critique it. '
