abstract: "The scope of digital curation at the BnF covers documents digitized from
  BnF collections as well as born-digital material bought by the BnF or collected
  under its legal deposit mandate. It is therefore critical for the library to investigate
  if common approaches may be adopted for similar document types, whatever their origin
  may be. This paper proposes to focus on the case of electronic books (or ebooks),
  by comparing the way BnF teams intend to ensure the long term preservation of those
  directly digitized by the library and those that will enter through legal deposit.\n\nData
  and metadata formats are different, even though EPUB appears as the reference format
  for both kinds of ebooks. Acquisition procedures are necessarily specific. However,
  for the other steps of the treatment process, digitized and born digital books should
  follow similar and parallel workflows: indexing in BnF General Catalogue, access
  through the digital library Gallica and preservation in SPAR, BnF’s digital repository.
  Common validation tools, characterization schemes and preservation metadata will
  be used in order to preserve both faces of French digital heritage. \n"
