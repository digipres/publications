abstract: In this paper, we describe a new initiative to develop a massive open online
  course (MOOC) for training library and information science students, library practitioners,
  and data producers in data curation. The Curating Research Assets and Data using
  Lifecycle Education (CRADLE) project exploits the affordances of MOOC technology
  to provide a networked learning environment that will encourage and foster the creation
  of research ecosystems in which CRADLE participants—library and information graduate
  students, library practitioners, and data producers—will have opportunities to collaborate
  with and learn from others engaged in data curation practice.
