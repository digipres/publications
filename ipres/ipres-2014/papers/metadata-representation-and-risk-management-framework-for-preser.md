abstract: This paper proposes an approach to assessing risks related to audiovisual
  (AV) preservation processes through gathering and representing metadata. We define
  a model for process metadata, which is interoperable with both business process
  models and other preservation metadata formats. A risk management framework is also
  suggested to help key decision makers to plan and execute preservation processes
  in a manner that reduces the risk of ‘damage’ to AV content. The framework uses
  a plan, do, check, act cycle to continuously improve the process based on risk measures
  and impact model. The process metadata serves as the interface between the steps
  in the framework and enables a unified approach to data gathering from the heterogeneous
  tools and devices used in an AV preservation workflow.
