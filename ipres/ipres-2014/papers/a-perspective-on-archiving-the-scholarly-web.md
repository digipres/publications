abstract: "As the scholarly communication system evolves to become natively web-based
  and starts supporting the communication of a wide variety of objects, the manner
  in which its essential functions â€“ registration, certification, awareness, archiving
  - are fulfilled co-evolves. This paper focuses on the nature of the archival function
  based on a perspective of the developing future scholarly communication infrastructure.
