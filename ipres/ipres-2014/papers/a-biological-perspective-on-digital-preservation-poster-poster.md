abstract: Successful preservation of Digital Objects (DOs) ultimately demands a solid
  theoretical framework. Such a framework with a high degree of generality emerges
  by treating DOs as containers of functional genetic information, exactly as in the
  genomes of organisms. We observe that functionality links survival in organisms
  and utility in DOs. In both cases, functional information is identifiable in principle
  by the consequence of its ablation. In molecular biology, genetic ablations (mutations)
  and environmental ablations (experimental manipulations) are used to construct interaction
  maps fully representing organismic activity. The equivalent of such interaction
  maps are dependency networks for the use of DOs within their Digital Environment
  (DE). In the poster we will present early work on the application of the theoretical
  background. It includes first results from a case-study examining a software-based
  art preservation scenario (SBA) developed as part of the PERICLES FP7 project.
