abstract: 'The archival community has recently been offered a series of cloud solutions
  providing various forms of digital preservation. However, Perservica is unique in
  providing not just bit-level preservation but the full gamut of digital preservation
  services that, up until recently, were available only to organizations using a system
  installed on-site following on from a complex, and potentially risky, software development
  project. This “new paradigm” thus offers a zero capital cost “pay as you go” model
  to perform not just bit-level preservation but also “active preservation”. This
  short paper will describe the practical difficulties of providing and operating
  such a comprehensive

  service in the cloud.


  A cloud system’s advantage is to reduce the need for capital costs (since hardware
  and software are rented not bought up front) and system maintenance (since this
  is provided by the system’s provider). To reduce costs further a system can share
  multiple organizations’ content on a single operational instance. However, this
  instance must maintain each such tenant organization’s isolation (i.e. one organization’s
  content must not be exposed to any others). In addition each tenancy must be able
  to control its own processes without being able to compromise those of other tenants.
  This leads to the need for some degree of tenancy administration (without placing
  on each tenant a large burden of administration that is best handled at the system
  level).


  The need to move bulk content across the internet as part of ingest cannot be avoided
  but the remaining ingest functionality can be performed either prior to upload (through
  a downloadable client-side tool) or server-side (through comprehensive workflows).
  Some ingest streams (e.g., web crawling) in fact can be considerably eased by using
  the cloud since an organization’s local internet bandwidth is no longer relevant.


  Other OAIS functional entities (preservation planning, data management, administration
  and storage) can all be performed without the need to move content across the internet.
  Access can be provided in a variety of forms including those suitable for archivists
  and those suitable for the general public. It is also possible to render content
  server-side to minimize the need for download.


  Importantly, it is also possible to export an organization’s entire content thereby
  providing a suitable “end of life” route to move to a different digital preservation
  system.
