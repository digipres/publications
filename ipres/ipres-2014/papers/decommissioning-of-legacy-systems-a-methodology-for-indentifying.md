abstract: "This paper provides an overview of the methodology and supporting advice
  developed by Queensland State Archives to help Queensland government departments
  undertaking the disposal or replacement of legacy ICT assets to lawfully manage
  the information content of those systems. Before deleting or investing in any preservation
  effort on records in decommissioning candidate systems, agencies need to have a
  clear understanding of: which records need to be kept and for how long; how to seek
  disposition authorisation for records which may have no ongoing value to the organisation;
  and what is and is not deemed a suitable preservation environment for managing records
  of ongoing value, from a recordkeeping perspective. Developed with the non-record
  professional in mind, a key message underpinning the methodology is that records
  as evidence of business activity are strategic assets in their own right, not just
  a byproduct of the business process, owned by the application. \n"
