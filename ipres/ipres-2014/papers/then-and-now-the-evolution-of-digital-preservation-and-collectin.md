abstract: "This paper reflects on a decade of digital collecting and digital preservation
  development at the National Library of New Zealand. It will examine the workflows,
  policies and tools that have been developed in the decade since the funding for
  the National Digital Heritage Archive was received. The paper will look closely
  at the requirements that were identified for the initial development of the digital
  preservation system and compare them to the status of the current preservation programme
  and requirements roadmap. \n"
