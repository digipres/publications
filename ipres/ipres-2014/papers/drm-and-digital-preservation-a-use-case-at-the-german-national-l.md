abstract: "Digital Rights Management (DRM) is in use for many digital publications.
  Digital libraries with a mandate to collect and preserve publications have to deal
  with technical challenges for preservation of DRM restricted objects. In the European
  project APARSEN a systematical classification of DRM methods and its risks for digital
  preservation was introduced. The German National Library handles the different types
  of DRM protections within the ingest workflow of the archival system by analysis
  and case-by-case distinction. \n"
