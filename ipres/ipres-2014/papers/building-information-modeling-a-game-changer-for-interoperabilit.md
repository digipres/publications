abstract: "Digital data associated with the architectural design-and construction
  process is an essential resource alongside -and even past- the lifecycle of the
  construction object it describes. Despite this, digital architectural data remains
  to be largely neglected in digital preservation research – and vice versa, digital
  preservation is so far neglected in the design-and-construction process. In the
  last 5 years, Building Information Modeling (BIM) has seen a growing adoption in
  the architecture and construction domains, marking a large step towards much needed
  interoperability. The open standard IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) is one way
  in which data is exchanged in BIM processes. This paper presents a first digital
  preservation based look at BIM processes, highlighting the history and adoption
  of the methods as well as the open file format standard IFC (Industry Foundation
  Classes) as one way to store and preserve BIM data. \n "
