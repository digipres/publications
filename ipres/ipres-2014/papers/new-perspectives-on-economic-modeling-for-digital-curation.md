abstract: 'Society is increasingly dependent on the availability of digital

  information assets however the resources that are available for

  managing the assets over time (curating) are limited. As such, it is

  increasingly vital that organizations are able to judge the

  effectiveness of their investments into curation activities. For

  those responsible for digital curation, it is an ongoing challenge to

  ensure that the assets remain valuable in a sustainable manner.

  Digital curation and preservation practices are still evolving and

  they are not well aligned across different organizations and

  different sectors. The lack of clear definitions and standardization

  makes it difficult to compare the costs and benefits of multiple

  curation processes, which again impedes identification of good

  practice. This paper introduces a new perspective on modeling the

  economics of curation. It describes a framework of interrelated

  models that represent different aspects of the economic lifecycle

  based around curation. The framework includes a sustainability

  model, a cost and benefit model, a business model, and a cost

  model. The framework provides a common vocabulary and

  clarifies the roles and responsibilities of managers with a demand

  for curation of digital assets and suppliers of curation services and

  solutions. Further, the framework reflects the context in which

  managers operate and how this context influences their decision-making. This should
  enable managers to think through different

  scenarios around the economics of curation and to analyze the

  impact of different decisions to support strategic planning. The

  framework is intended to serve as a basis for developing tools to

  help managers analyze the costs and benefits associated with

  curation. The models are being developed and refined as part of

  the EU project 4C “Collaboration to Clarify the Cost of Curation”,

  which is bringing together and bridging existing knowledge,

  models and tools to create a better understanding of the economics

  of curation.'
