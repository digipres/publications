abstract: The digital preservation community has had a chequered history in developing
  software tools to perform operations essential for preserving digital data. Poor
  technology choices, half measures in adopting open source approaches, insufﬁcient
  engagement with users, ﬁnite project funding and an array of other challenges have
  hampered tool development. Gaps in capability are common but even where tools have
  been created to take on a particular problem, they oﬁen face patchy support and
  an uncertain future. Lessons have however been learned from mistakes that have been
  made in the past. User engagement and an agile development approach can focus solutions
  on real problems. Adoption and expansion of existing tools (sometimes from outside
  of this community) can yield greater and more dependable results. Focused designs
  can make adoption easier. Sharing the experimentation and data behind tool development
  and assessment can be as invaluable as the tools themselves. This paper provides
  an outline of lessons learned from developing digital preservation tools across
  JISC and EU ﬁmded digital preservation projects, such as PLANETS and SCAPE and more
  recently from agile hackathon and mashup events run by SPRUCE.
