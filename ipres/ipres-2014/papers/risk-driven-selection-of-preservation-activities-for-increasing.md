abstract: 'The increasing demands faced by repository systems and the growing popularity
  of workflow systems introduces new risks, creating new challenges to the digital
  preservation community. The application of risk management practices to digital
  preservation is a way of managing the risks associated with the use of such systems
  and to optimize the application of digital preservation treatments to such risks.
  In this paper, we present results of a case study conducted on two use cases: a
  repository system and an automated workflow representing a typical digital preservation
  quality assessment process. We used a risk assessment approach to identify risks
  related not only to the technical but also organizational and legal aspects. We
  assigned controls which decrease their impact and explained how the digital preservation
  related controls can also improve the current functioning of the repository system
  and increase reproducibility of the workflows.'
