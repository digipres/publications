abstract: "The role of government archival institutions is to ensure that essential
  evidence of the business of government is made, kept and used. This evidence now
  resides in a wide array of systems and structures; from large centralised case management
  systems to collaborative workspaces in the cloud. Government archives work with
  agencies on systems design, improvements and migrations with good recordkeeping
  their goal. \n "
