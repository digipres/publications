abstract: "This workshop provides high-level information on the features, development
  and current status of ISO standards for PDF relevant to archiving. It then provides
  an opportunity for participants to clearly identify and prioritize related requirements
  and solutions. Presented by the ISO Project Leader of ISO 32000, an independent
  consultant, the workshop will begin by reviewing the features and history of the
  technology and its associated standards. Thereafter, a set of breakout sessions
  will challenge participants to clearly specify their ideas and concerns about PDF
  and suggest a variety of solutions leveraging commercial software interests. Finally,
  workshop participants will come together to discuss the breakout session results,
  identify common themes and build consensus on specific, actionable requests for
  PDF producer and processor developers in the short and medium term. \n"
