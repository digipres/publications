abstract: 'This paper presents an approach for merging information automatically aggregated
  from open repositories and expert knowledge related to digital preservation. The
  main contribution of this work is the employment of fuzzy models to support digital
  preservation experts with semi-automatic estimation of “endangerment level” for
  file formats. Our goal is to make use of a solid knowledge base automatically aggregated
  from linked open data repositories to detect conflicts and inaccuracies in this
  data in order to improve the quality of a risk analysis process. The proposed method
  is meant to facilitate decision making with regard to preservation of digital content
  in libraries and archives using domain expert knowledge. To allow reasoning, even
  in the case of inconsistent data, we employ fuzzy logic techniques for transforming
  information about formats with user friendly metrics. The goal is to bring conflicting
  and incorrect information to the surface for correction and improvement by community.
  The analysis of a survey regarding the risk factors for file formats was used as
  an input for the fuzzy model and is presented in the evaluation section.
