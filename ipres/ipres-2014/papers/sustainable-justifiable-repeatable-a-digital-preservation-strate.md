abstract: 'Appraisal has long been a source of intense debate in the archival community.
  Digital collections, affordable storage costs, and software tools now offer the
  opportunity to enhance appraisal strategies and move the archival appraisal discussion
  productively forward. In this poster, we propose an iterative, technology-assisted,
  metrics-based approach to appraisal as part of a digital preservation strategy.
  Developed in concert with a Capstone-based project to preserve email messages of
  enduring value at the University of Illinois, this multimodal approach integrates
  various traditional appraisal techniques with business performance metrics for the
  purpose of achieving growth that is sustainable using justifiable appraisal decisions,
  applying repeatable processes, and ultimately establishing measurable institutional
  value. '
