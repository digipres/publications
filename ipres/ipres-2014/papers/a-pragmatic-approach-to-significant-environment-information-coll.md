abstract: When aiming to ensure the long-term usage of digital objects, it is important
  to carefully select what information to keep, considering also what lives outside
  of them. In the PERICLES project we start by analysing how such information has
  been described in related work, considering common definitions of metadata, context,
  significant properties and environment, and we come to the conclusion that we need
  to consider the broadest set of information, which we term environment information.
  Building on previous deﬁnitions, we introduce the concept of Significant Environment
  Information (SE1) that takes into account the dependencies of the digital object
  on external information for speciﬁc purposes and significance weights that express
  the importance of such dependencies for the specific purpose. From there we expand
  the definition in time considering the importance of collecting SEI during any phase
  of the digital object lifecycle, following the sheer curation perspective. Examples
  of SEI are illustrated in the very diverse use cases considered in the project,
  that include diverse data types from the Art domain and data from space observations
  in the Science domain. Finally we introduce our PERICLES Extraction Tool, that we
  developed to capture SEI, and present methods to extract SEI with experimental results
  supporting the approach. The PET tool automates the novel techniques we describe,
  supports sheer curation, as a continuous transparent collection process that otherwise
  the user (e.g. scientist, artist in our use cases) would have to find time to perform
  manually.
