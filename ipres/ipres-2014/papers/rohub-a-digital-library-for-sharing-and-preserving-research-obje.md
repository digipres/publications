abstract: 'ROHub is a digital library system, enhanced with Semantic Web technologies,
  which supports the storage, lifecycle management, sharing and preservation of research
  objects – semantic aggregations of related scientific resources, their annotations
  and research context. ROHub includes a set of features to help scientists throughout
  the research lifecycle to create and maintain high-quality research objects that
  can be interpreted and reproduced in the future, including quality assessment, evolution
  management, navigation through provenance information and monitoring features. It
  provides a set of RESTful APIs along with a Web Interface for users and developers.
  A demo installation is available at: www.rohub.org.'
