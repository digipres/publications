abstract: Digitization workflows for automatic acquisition of image collections are
  susceptible to errors and require quality assurance. This paper presents a quality
  assurance tool suite for long term preservation. These tools support decision making
  for blank pages, cropping errors, mistakenly appearing fingers in scans and accurate
  duplicate detection in document image collections. The important contribution of
  this work is a definition of the quality assurance workflow and its automatic computation.
  The goal is to create a reliable tool suite that is based on image processing techniques.
