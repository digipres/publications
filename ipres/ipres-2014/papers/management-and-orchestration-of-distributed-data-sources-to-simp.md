abstract: 'Emulation-as-a-Service makes emulation widely available for non-experts
  and thus, emulation could prove valuable as a tool in digital preservation workflows.
  Providing these emulation services to access preserved and archived digital objects
  poses further challenges to data management. Digital artifacts are usually stored
  and maintained in dedicated repositories and object owners want to or are required
  to stay in control over their intellectual property.


  In this paper we propose a distributed storage and data access model that ensures
  that the user stays in control over his digital objects by simultaneously providing
  efficient data transport and support for (space) efficient management of user modifications.
  Finally, a mechanism for orchestration of both storage and emulation services to
  re-enact a single pre-defined setup is presented.
