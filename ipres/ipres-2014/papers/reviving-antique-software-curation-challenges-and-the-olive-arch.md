abstract: 'A growing percentage of the world''s intellectual output is in the form
  of executable content, such as simulation models, tutoring systems, data visualization
  tools, and expert systems. To preserve this content over time, we need to freeze
  and precisely reproduce the execution that dynamically produces that content. Olive,
  a rough acronym for “Open Library of Images for Virtualized Execution,” is a system
  built at Carnegie Mellon University. Olive preserves and provides access to this
  executable content. It relies on virtual machine (VM) technology to bundle software
  with all of its dependencies. These VMs are streamed over the internet in real time
  to ensure a smooth user experience while maintaining fidelity to the original execution
  environment.


  This demonstration examines some of the challenges the Olive team has encountered
  in the process of preserving software over the last several years. Among these difficulties
  are technical challenges, problems of scale, legal limitations, and a lack of existing
  curation standards for executable content.
