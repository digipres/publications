abstract: When using emulation to render digital objects, a dedicated system environment
  is required. This environment typically consists of a set of software, i.e. an emulator,
  replicating the original hardware, operating system, hardware drivers, application
  as well as tools and utilities. Typically such technical meta-data is modelled using
  a view-path. Configuration and operating knowledge, however, is also required and
  needs to be described and preserved to secure deterministic future environment and
  workflow replication. One possible solution is to capture and replay human-machine
  interaction in an abstract way. A model for recording and capturing interactions
  between human users and an emulated machine has already been proposed. With the
  integration of such a system in an Emulation-as-a-Service service model, usability
  has been improved significantly by integration the capturing and replay into EaaS
  workflows. This demo’s purpose is to demonstrate the system’s usability and utility
  for digital preservation tasks like automation, documentation and replication of
  interactive tasks.
