abstract: "This paper asks the question “what form of digital preservation collective
  is best for Scotland?” and then sets out the options being explored under the leadership
  of the National Library of Scotland (NLS). As a result this paper straddles several
  areas across the themes of the conference. It deals with the desire for the creation
  of an integrated national preservation infrastructure in Scotland. It also looks
  at the ways we can develop an appetite for collaboration to align differing institutional
  contexts for preservation to build a better community. Additionally it examines
  issues around working within the strategic environment to coordinate local, regional
  and national approaches across Scotland and the United Kingdom. \n"
