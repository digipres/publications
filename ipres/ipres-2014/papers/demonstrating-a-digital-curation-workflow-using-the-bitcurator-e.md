abstract: ' This demonstration will highlight several key steps in a digital curation
  workflow that incorporates digital forensics tools and methods. Using the open-source
  BitCurator environment, I will demonstrate several discrete tasks, how they can
  feed into each other, and considerations related to incorporating them into a larger
  set of curation practices within collecting institutions. A strong emphasis will
  be placed on features of the software that have been added or enhanced over the
  past year, including mounting and exporting of files from forensically packaged
  disk images, identification of duplicate files, generation of PREMIS metadata and
  initial steps toward redaction of potentially sensitive information.'
