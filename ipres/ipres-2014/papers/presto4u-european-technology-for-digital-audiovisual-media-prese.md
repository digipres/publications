abstract: 'This poster describes the actions, progress and research results of the
  Presto4U project, an EC funded two year coordination and support action which started
  in January 2013 focussing on the long term preservation of digital audiovisual media
  within a diverse range of Communities of Practice. The aim of the project is to
  identify useful results of research into digital audiovisual preservation and to
  raise awareness and improve the adoption of these both by technology and service
  providers as well as media owners. It will deliver new tools and services to connect
  different constituencies involved in AV Media preservation: expert users, who understand
  the problems and require technological solutions; researchers who can develop the
  fundamental knowledge; and technology providers who can commercialise research results
  as sustainable tools and services.'
