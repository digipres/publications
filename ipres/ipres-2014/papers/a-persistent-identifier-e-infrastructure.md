abstract: Persistent identifiers (PIDs) have been recognized as a crucial enabling
  component for 2020 e-science infrastructures, having the potential of providing
  global keys for information access, reuse and exchange and creating a complex network
  of links which connect all the relevant entities in the research data landscape
  (e.g. digital objects to authors and datasets, authors to institutions and projects,
  projects to research products and fundings). The creation and full exploitation
  of this valuable network of connections is currently hindered by the fragmentation
  and lack of coordination of the persistent identifier ecosystem. Several initiatives
  have emerged with the aim of offering global identifier repositories for digital
  and non-digital entities but they are still focused on the needs of specific communities
  and the lack of interoperability between them is one of the major hurdles for the
  development of a globally connected scholarly infrastructure. The aim of this paper
  is to propose a Persistent Identifier e-infrastructure (based on an identifier service
  called Entity Name System) which provides a technical layer of interoperability
  which allows current identifier systems to interoperate and be coordinated across
  geographical, temporal, disciplinary, organization and technological boundaries.
  The Persistent Identifier interoperability e-infrastructure is presented as a cross-cutting
  core service enabling the development of advanced added-value services tailored
  to the specific needs of different communities and stakeholders of the e-science
  environment.
