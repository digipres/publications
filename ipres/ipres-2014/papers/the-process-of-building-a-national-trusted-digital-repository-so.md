abstract: "The Digital Repository of Ireland (DRI) is building an interactive national
  trusted digital repository for contemporary and historical, social and cultural
  data held by Irish institutions. It will provide a central Internet access point
  and interactive multimedia tools, for use by the public, students and scholars and
  inform national policy for digital preservation and access. In 2011/2012 DRI conducted
  a requirements analysis of stakeholder needs. This paper focuses on how aspects
  of this requirements analysis are translated into technical and policy solutions.
  We address how the project consortium, comprising six academic institutions, integrates
  with existing partner repositories and how the Digital Repository of Ireland tackles
  issues of repository federation in terms of storage, deposit and the legal frameworks
  associated with these activities. \n "
