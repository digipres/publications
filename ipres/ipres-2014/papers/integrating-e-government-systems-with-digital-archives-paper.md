abstract: "While interoperability between active e-government systems has been a significant
  area of work during the last decade, the fact that much of this information needs
  to be preserved for the long-term after the initial creation has been ignored, and
  the re-use of data has been of secondary concern. This paper looks into the needs
  of long-term preservation of digital-born e-government data and describes how the
  EC-funded E-ARK project proposes further actions to address the challenge in a cost-effective
  manner. \n"
