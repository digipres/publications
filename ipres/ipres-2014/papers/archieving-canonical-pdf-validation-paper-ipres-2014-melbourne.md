abstract: 'While PDF is the best currently available option for archiving fixed-form
  electronic documents, low quality PDF files remain problematic throughout the document
  lifecycle, and can pose substantial challenges for memory institutions.


  This paper proposes a model for realizing and promulgating PDF validation based
  on a canonical (i.e. accepted industry-wide as definitive) approach rather than
  focusing on preservation per se.  '
