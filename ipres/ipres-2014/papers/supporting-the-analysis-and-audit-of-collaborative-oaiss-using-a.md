abstract: " This paper addresses the question: What would distributed digital preservation
  look like using the OAIS Reference Model? The challenge is the need for several
  organizations to cooperate to achieve distributed digital preservation; using replication,
  independence, and coordination to address the known threats to digital content through
  time. The main purpose of the paper is to present an Outer OAIS-Inner OAIS (OO-IO)
  Model that can support the analysis and audit of collaborative interactions between
  multiple OAIS’s to enable distributed digital preservation. The paper provides extensive
  explanations and diagrams to demonstrate the ability of the OO-IO model to address
  distributed digital preservation conformance with the Open Archival Information
  System (OAIS) Reference Model. It is argued that the OO-IO model contributes a necessary
  extension to the literature of the digital preservation community to address the
  analysis and audit necessary for distributed digital preservation. \n"
