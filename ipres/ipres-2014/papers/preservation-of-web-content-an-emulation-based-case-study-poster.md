abstract: A significant amount of cultural activity has moved to the world wide web
  preservation of web content is becoming increasingly important. But with growing
  complexity and dynamics of web sites, a harvesting approach to web preservation
  has its limitations. We present a web preservation case study using a functional
  approach both for preservation and presentation. By using Emulation-as-a-Service
  (EaaS), a complete web site (web server, content management system, database) can
  be preserved and functionally re-enacted efficiently on demand.
