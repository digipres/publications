abstract: 'Awareness of the need to provide digital preservation solutions is spreading
  from the core memory institutions to other domains, including government, industry,
  SME and consumers. In many of these settings we are, however, faced with preserving
  more than just data. In the domain of eScience, for example, investigations are
  increasingly collaborative. Most scientific and engineering domains benefit from
  building on the outputs of other research by sharing information to reason over
  and data to incorporate in the modeling task at hand.


  This raises the need for preserving and sharing entire eScience workflows and processes
  for later reuse. We need to define which information is to be collected, create
  means to preserve it and approaches to enable and validate the re-execution of a
  preserved process. This includes and goes beyond preserving the data used in the
  experiments, as the process underlying its creation and use is essential.


  The TIMBUS project and Wf4Ever project team up for this halfday tutorial to provide
  an introduction to the problem domain and discuss solutions for the curation of
  eScience processes. '
