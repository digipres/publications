abstract: 'The Memento protocol tightly integrates the Web of the Present and that
  of the Past, making it possible to seamlessly navigate between both. The protocol
  defines an interoperable approach to access versions of a resource in web archives
  or content management systems such as wikis that leverage the URI of that resource
  and the datetime of the required resource version. Technically, the Memento protocol
  is an extension of HTTP that is fully based on the primitives of Web interoperability:
  URIs, resource representations, links, content negotiation. The tutorial will give
  an in-depth insight in various aspects of the Memento protocol that meanwhile has
  been published as RFC 7089. '
