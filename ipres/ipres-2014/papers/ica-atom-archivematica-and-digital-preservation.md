abstract: 'ICA-AtoM is an open source, web-based archival description software application
  that is based on International Council on Archives standards. The first version
  of it was released in 2008 with funding from a variety of organisations including
  UNESCO, World Bank Group Archives, the Dutch Archiefschool, the Direction des Archives
  de France and the United Arab Emirates Centre for Documentation and Research. In
  2013, the State Records Office of Western Australia (SROWA) has invested in further
  development of the software, chiefly to include support for the Australian Series
  Registration System as well as simple preservation workflow. These additions to
  ICA-AtoM will be completed in the middle of 2014 and made freely available as part
  of the open source package to any archives wishing to download the software.


  This work has aligned the Australian Series Registration System within an international
  standard ISAD compliant system, and will go some way to eventually bringing the
  two together. This workshop will provide an overview of using ICA AtoM with special
  attention to archival description using the Australian Series Registration System;
  ingest into the complementary Archivematica digital preservation system and attaching
  digital objects to AtoM.


  The workshop is open to the public. '
