abstract: ' This paper presents Epimenides, a system that implements a novel interoperability
  dependency reasoning approach for assisting digital preservation activities. A distinctive
  feature is that it can model also converters and emulators, and the adopted modelling
  approach enables the automatic reasoning needed for reducing the human effort required
  for checking (and monitoring) whether a task on a digital object (digital collection
  in general) is performable. Finally, the paper describes (in the form of scenarios)
  concrete preservation activities of a research data archive (DANS) and elaborates
  on how Epimenides could be used and the benefits that would bring.'
