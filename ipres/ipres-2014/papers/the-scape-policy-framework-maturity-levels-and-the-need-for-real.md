abstract: "A digital preservation policy is an essential document in which an organization
  summarizes its approaches to achieve the goals and objectives for the long term
  preservation of the collections in its digital archive. In this paper the reference
  to preservation policies in various standards is compared with a set of publicly
  available preservation policies, showing that there is a big gap between theory
  and practice. Recent work done in the European project SCAPE (http://www.scape-project.eu/)
  in building a Catalogue of Policy Elements could contribute to bridging this gap.
  The paper concludes with suggestions to further develop the practical use of preservation
  policies by aligning them to the maturity level of the organization. \n "
