abstract: 'The reproducibility of modern research depends on the possibility to faithfully
  rerun the complex and distributed data transformation processes which were executed
  by scientists in order to make new scientific breakthroughs. New methods and frameworks
  try to address this problem by collecting evidence used for verification of such
  experiments. However, there is still a lack of a flexible data model which would
  address all of the needs of these methods. This paper presents the VPlan ontology
  designed for the purpose of organizing and storing of data collected for verification
  of preserved processes. The VPlan ontology stores and links the data extracted from
  the preserved process. Furthermore, it includes descriptions of actions taken to
  collect the data, as well as provides a clear break down of requirements that lead
  to its collection. We demonstrate the usage of the VPlan ontology within the preservation
  process and describe in detail its alignment with the Verification Framework (VFramework).
  In order to illustrate its applicability to the eScience domain, we evaluate it
  on a use case from the civil engineering domain, which is an example of a typical
  sensor data analysis process. '
