abstract: "To date, digital preservation has generally focused on the preservation
  of specific data in the form of artefacts. However, in order to ensure that this
  data is accessible in the long term, it is vital that we consider how to extract
  and preserve information on the software and hardware contexts which this data depends
  upon to operate. We therefore need tools to assist in identifying, preserving and
  validating the processes which underpin the creation of data in digital libraries.
  \n\nIn particular, we need to consider the importance of preserving not just individual
  digital artefacts, but the platforms which allow digital libraries to render or
  execute their items. Digital libraries rely on this software to render their items,
  and it is therefore important to know configuration details and software dependencies
  to ensure these items remain fully operational in the future. In the case of digital
  libraries, the TIMBUS framework provides the tools necessary to assist practitioners
  in identifying relevant processes, undertake risk analysis, and then to assist the
  user in extracting, preserving and revalidating the necessary processes.\n\nThis
  half-day tutorial introduces the TIMBUS approach to process preservation, and demonstrates
  how it can be applied to issues relating to digital libraries. TIMBUS focuses primarily
  on business processes, but this tutorial will show its approach to process-oriented
  preservation is also relevant to digital libraries. It provides a methodology for
  process preservation and a set of tools which help to semi-automatically validate
  and preserve processes so that they can be recreated at a later dat. Participants
  will be given the knowledge to understand the importance of technical environments
  for collection items, and learn more about the TIMBUS solutions through examples
  relevant to the digital library domain. They will also gain an understanding of
  digital preservation as a risk mitigation strategy. \n "
