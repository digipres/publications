abstract: "The Programme Committee created a panel for this yearâ€™s conference that
  was structured to generate introspection in the digital preservation community.
  The panel took the form of a debate between international figures and debated the
  question: Digital Preservation: Are we succeeding? The following are notes compiled
  from the event, rather than a summary and conclusion. A video of the event is available
  on the iPRES 2014 website. \n\n "
