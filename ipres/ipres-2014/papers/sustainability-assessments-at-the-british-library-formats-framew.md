abstract: "File format assessments have been the subject of much debate in and outside
  of the preservation community in the past decade. Recognizing the unique structural,
  operational, and collecting context of the British Library, the Library’s digital
  preservation team recently initiated new format assessment work to deliver recommendations
  on which file formats will best enable the preservation of integral, authentic representations
  of British Library collection content over the long term. This paper describes the
  work carried out to review previous assessments, identify appropriate sustainability
  categories and newly assess formats accordingly.\n\nWe posit that the relatively
  ‘fuzzy’ nature of a file format requires a relatively open-ended assessment framework
  and a nuanced understanding of preservation risk that does not solely lie with ‘all-or-nothing’
  format obsolescence. We review other work in this area and suggest that whilst previous
  format assessment work has addressed a range of subtly different aims, experience
  has since indicated that some of the criteria used - such as considering number
  of pages in a format specification as a measure of complexity - may be invalid.
  British Library assessments are made on documented points of principle, for example,
  an emphasis on evidence-based preservation risks and the avoidance of numerical
  scores leading to comparisons between formats, and these have formed the base upon
  which sustainability categories are defined. We present these categories, which
  help to identify preservation risks or other challenges in the management of digital
  collections, and provide an overview of initial assessments of three formats: TIFF,
  JP2, and PDF. We acknowledge however, that implementation of preservation requirements,
  e.g., the use of particular preservation-justified file formats, must be balanced
  against other business requirements, such as storage costs and access needs, and
  argue that transparency of this format assessment process is fundamental if the
  resulting recommendations are to be fully understood in the future.\n "
