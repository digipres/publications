abstract: This paper introduces the motivation and describes the model of a novel
  metadata standard for the exchange of preservation metadata of multimedia content.
  The model is being standardised as the MPEG Multimedia Preservation Application
  Format (MPAF), addressing the specific issues related to the preservation description
  information of audiovisual contents. Several standards for expressing metadata in
  digital preservation are available and have been taken into consideration in the
  paper and in the work done in MPEG. However, none of them is able to cover all the
  needed aspects related to the preservation of audiovisual content. Audiovisual files
  are in most cases containers and are usually made up of several tracks carrying
  audio data, video data and specific time-based metadata. In order to be able to
  perform the opportune preservation actions (among others planning and format migration),
  several kinds of information must be kept alongside the audiovisual contents. Within
  this context a standardised representation for these structures and metadata is
  needed. Information such as quality description or fixity at frame level is required
  for ensuring long term access to visual content. Without using a standardised interface
  it is hard to guarantee a faithful rendering of encoded information while exchanging
  contents between different repositories, either internally or with external institutions.
  This paper describes the work done so far within MPEG for defining a standard metadata
  model which covers the identified missing parts and gaps regarding the acquisition
  of digital preservation description information.
