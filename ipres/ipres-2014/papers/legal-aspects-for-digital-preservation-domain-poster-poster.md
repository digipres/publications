abstract: Long term digital preservation serves the preservation of data substance
  and operability, so that future users are enabled to use stored data and rerun the
  preserved processes to gain the stored information. Furthermore, Law is becoming
  an essential application domain for technology developments. In case copyright protected
  data has to be digitally preserved, every process of a digital preservation system
  may violate this right, when the rightholder who has the exclusive rights did not
  grant the relevant rights of use. This paper shows a Legal Ontology that provides
  a hierarchical overview of how legal constraints and obligations (e.g. IP rights
  and licensing issues) could be implemented in an automated process of a DP system.
  In simply terms, difficulties with legal taxonomies may arises when the creators
  and the users don’t share the same perspective. This would be the case when the
  creators of the taxonomy are lawyers and the users not. Legal taxonomies for digital
  preservation can be represented with ontologies which are an explicit account of
  a shared understanding in any domain. Through the use of ontologies the communication
  can be improved, which, in turn, can give rise to greater reuse, sharing, transparency,
  and interoperability. Every DP activity must ensure the authenticity and legitimacy
  of the performed actions and processes. Hence to validate the correctness of our
  legal ontology we used a set of competency questions defined in a specific case
  study. The goal is to obtain a clearer taxonomical view of the necessary legal knowledge
  that will address the concerns of industrial use-case DP stakeholders. Therefore,
  we recommend using the Legal Ontology for the DP domain, in order to integrate different
  legal perspectives and perform reasoning and inference over legal knowledge and
  information.
