abstract: In developing and debating digital repositories, the digital library world
  has devoted more attention to their missions and roles in supporting access to and
  stewardship of academic research output than to discussing discipline, or domain,
  specific digital repositories. This is especially interesting, given that in social
  science these domain-specific repositories have been in existence for many decades.
  The goal of this presentation is to juxtapose these two kinds of repositories and
  to suggest ways that they can help build partnerships between themselves and with
  the research community. It is based on the fundamental idea that all the parties
  involved share important goals, and that by working together these goals can be
  advanced successfully. We will begin by characterizing the life cycle of social
  science research, before turning to key elements of the two different kinds of repositories,
  and then to our recommendation that researchers and the two different kinds of repositories
  can forge partnerships. The key message is that by visualizing the role of repositories
  explicitly in the life cycle of the social science research enterprise, the ways
  that the partnerships work will be clear. These workings can be seen as a sequence
  of reciprocal information flows between parties to the process, triggers that signal
  that one party or another has a task to perform, and hand-offs of information from
  one party to another that take place at crucial moments. This approach envisions
  both cooperation and specialization. The researcher produces the scientific product,
  both data and publications; the institutional repository has specialized knowledge
  of campus conditions and the opportunity to interact frequently with the researcher;
  and the domain-specific repository has specialized knowledge of approaches to data
  in a specific scientific field, for example domain-specific metadata standards,
  as well as the ability to give high-impact exposure to research products.
