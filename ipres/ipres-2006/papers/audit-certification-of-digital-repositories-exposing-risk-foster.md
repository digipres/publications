abstract: 'Over the last three years, the RLG - NARA Task for on Digital Repository
  certification has worked to develop a checklist which would allow objective evaluation
  of digital repositories and archives. The checklist was based upon international
  standards and community best practices for digital preservation as well as influences
  from information technology and information security standards. The goal was to
  develop metrics to evaluate three aspects influencing repository trustworthiness:
  the characteristics of the archiving organization that affect performance, accountability,
  and business continuity; technologies and technical infrastructure employed by the
  repository; and finally the processes and procedures utilized by the repository.
  A draft checklist was released for public consumption and comment in August 2005,
  leading to further development. In addition, the checklist has been leveraged by
  the Center for Research Libraries Auditing and Certification of Digital Archives
  project and used in test audits of three digital repositories and archives. Through
  public comment, practical application, and other CRL project activities, we have
  made further progress toward the development of a fully-fledged program of audit
  & certification for digital repositories. This presentation will discuss checklist
  development, envisioned uses of the checklist, the emerging audit & certification
  process, potential audit & certification process outputs, and compliance issues.'
