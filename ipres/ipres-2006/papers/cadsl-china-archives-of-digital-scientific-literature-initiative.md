abstract: Dr. Zhang will present the China Archives of Digital Scientific Literature
  (CADSL) Initiative, proposed to the Ministry of Science and Technology of China,
  as the result of a feasibility study by the National Science and Technology Library
  of China. Based on a need and crisis analysis, a distributed network of trusted
  archives with sustainable planning and administration mechanisms is suggested to
  preserve digital scientific information resources, including foreign published literature,
  home-grown literature, and scientific web resources. Outlined in the proposed initiative
  is (1) a distributed and shared system of responsibility to archive the targeted
  resources, (2) a framework of guidelines for intellectual property protection of
  preserved materials, (3) an open and continuous certification process for trusted
  repositories, (4) a rigorous set of outlines of technological, workflow management,
  service level agreement requirements for prospective archives, and (5) a public
  and yet competitive funding mechanism to utilize multiple resources for the initiative.
  Ways to mobilize research and educational institutions into the initiatives and
  future efforts to promote and collaborate with scientific data preservation and
  cultural heritage preservation are discussed in the end.
