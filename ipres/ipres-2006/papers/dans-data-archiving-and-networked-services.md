abstract: DANS is the new Dutch organization, which has been tasked with the preservation
  and permanent access to research data in the humanities and the social sciences.
  The two main scientific administrative organizations in the Netherlands, the Royal
  Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) and the Netherlands Organisation
  for Scientific Research (NWO), are jointly responsible for DANS. DANS aims to promote
  (interdisciplinary) collaboration with and among researchers. DANS is also the Dutch
  national partner in European and other international data organizations. DANS is
  also an intermediary to researchers for the delivery of large databases from organizations
  such as Statistics Netherlands, The Social and Cultural Planning agency and the
  Topographical Service. Already existing data archives like the social science data
  archive 'Steinmetzarchief' and the Netherlands Historical Data Archive (NHDA) have
  been merged in DANS. DANS has been mandated to expand and improve the current data
  research infrastructure. New initiatives for data services and data archives are
  being developed in fields where such facilities have been lacking until recently.
  These TOPical Programmes (TOPs) are set up in collaboration with research groups.
  Work on the renewal of the infrastructure for digital data archiving is in progress.
  Innovation and staying ahead in the ICT-development is one of the main spearheads
  of this new organization. To be able to apply fundamental research findings to systems
  used for archiving and providing access to data DANS has established its own development
  team. For the acquisition of data sets, collaboration with faculties, research schools
  and academic institutes will be invigorated. DANS developed in collaboration with
  researchers in the field and the Netherlands Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning
  and the Environment (VROM) a user-friendly repository for research archiving. Now
  researchers are able to place their research data in DANS compliant data repositories.
  They can rely on a safe preservation and curation of their data and they can share
  their data with other researchers. DANS aims to make access to research data as
  open as possible.
