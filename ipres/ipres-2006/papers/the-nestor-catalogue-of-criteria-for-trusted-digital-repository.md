  This criteria catalogue primarily addresses cultural heritage organizations, federal
  archives, libraries and museums and is designed as a guideline for the planning
  and setup of a digital long-term preservation repository. Secondarily, this catalogue
  can be an orientation guide for software developers, third party vendors or service
  provides from the private sector. The nestor catalogue focuses on its applicability
  in Germany. Still, it must be discussed internationally and should adhere to international
  standards.'
