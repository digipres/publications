abstract: 'Web Archive Switzerland is a pilot project undertaken in collaboration
  with the Swiss Cantonal libraries as part of the e-Helvetica Project at the Swiss
  National Library (SNL). The mission of the SNL and the Swiss Cantonal libraries
  is to collect and archive all Swiss publications, both printed and electronic. The
  objective of the e-Helvetica Project is to fulfill this mission for electronic publications.
  The Web Archive Switzerland pilot project recently designed and tested a shared
  workflow for selecting, collecting, cataloguing, archiving and disseminating non-commercial
  Swiss web resources. Within the workflow the Cantonal libraries are responsible
  for the identification, selection and announcement of data on the Web. The SNL is
  responsible for the web-harvesting (objects and rights), cataloguing, archiving
  and dissemination of those identified web resources. The aim of this co-operation
  is to share resources and knowledge. This presentation will give some historical
  context to Web Archive Switzerland and discuss the collaboration with the Cantonal
  libraries and the shared workflow. The approach chosen for selecting, cataloguing
  and harvesting the web resources will be highlighted as well as our experiences
  to date. The presentation will conclude with some ideas on how we are planning to
  disseminate the web resources. For further information on the e-Helvetica Project
