abstract: The work of the academy – research and teaching – is not possible without
  reliable access to the accumulated scholarship of the past. One component of this
  scholarly record, academic journals, is increasingly electronic – and fragile –
  and its future accessibility is a growing concern. The recent statement "Urgent
  Action Needed to Preserve Scholarly Electronic Journals" endorsed by leading libraries
  and organizations such as ARL, ALCTS and others underscores the urgency of this
  community need. But the scale and complexity of the technology infrastructure, specialized
  expertise and quality control processes necessary to preserve electronic resources
  exceeds that which can be supported by any individual library or institutional budget.
  This presentation will provide a brief history of Portico, the not-for-profit electronic
  archiving service developed in response to the library community's need for a robust,
  reliable means to preserve electronic scholarly journals. Portico was initiated
  by JSTOR and has been developed with the initial support of Ithaka, The Andrew W.
  Mellon Foundation, and the Library of Congress. Portico's mission is to preserve
  scholarly literature published in electronic form and to ensure that these materials
  remain accessible to future scholars, researchers, and students. In addition to
  an overview of the Portico service and access model developed with input from publishers
  and libraries, the presentation will include an update on library and publisher
  participation and the status of Portico's archival operations.
