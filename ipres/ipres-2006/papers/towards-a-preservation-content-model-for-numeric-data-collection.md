abstract: This session will outline the workflow associated with migrating social
  science data collections into FEDORA, focusing on the implementation of PREMIS metadata
  as a component of the submission information package (SIP). Presenters will identify
  how the PREMIS data model serves to specialize the packaging of the SIP so that
  access aids can exploit the information package when it is transformed into an archival
  information package (AIP). Presenters will outline an example expression of PREMIS
  for social science datasets and will demonstrate how this metadata may be stored
  in a FEDORA repository. Data management issues including normalization will also
  be explored. Examples from the ongoing project to migrate the Yale Social Science
  Data Archive from a postgreSQL database into FEDORA will be provided.
