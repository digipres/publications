abstract: The N2T ("entity") identifier resolver addresses the same problem as URN,
  Handle, and DOI resolvers, but does so without complex or proprietary software components.
  N2T is lower-risk than those resolvers because it relies only on off-the-shelf open-source
  components, and it is the only resolver to acknowledge and address the "namespace
  splitting problem". N2T (Name-to-Thing) is both a persistent identifier resolver
  and a consortium of cultural memory organizations. The consortium has no fees or
  requirements, and merely offers its members the option to publicize a protected
  form of their URLs supported by the resolver. The resolver is a small, standard
  web server run in several mirrored instances by consortium volunteers under one
  hostname rented for about $30 USD per year. The resolver works equally well with
  any identifier scheme (URLs, ARKs, Handles, DOIs, URNs, PURLs) that can be expressed
  inside a URL.
