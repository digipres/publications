abstract: 'People with responsibility for scholarly assets agree that digital preservation
  is important. Tomorrow''s readers will need today''s materials; without preservation
  they won''t exist. Librarians and publishers are asking two fundamental questions:
  From this moment on, who will have custody of society''s electronic information?
  From this moment on, who will control and govern society''s electronic archival
  assets? With LOCKSS over 150 libraries and over 80 publishers are working together
  to ensure no one organization has control over our intellectual heritage. By ensuring
  libraries can build collections and retain their role as long-term memory organizations
  in the electronic environment LOCKSS avoids the social hazards of centrally controlled
  information. With CLOCKSS 12 large publishers and seven libraries are working towards
  similar goals. For over 8 years the OAIS-compliant, format-agnostic, open source
  LOCKSS system has been demonstrating it can ingest a wide range of web content,
  audit and repair it to ward off damage and attacks, and transparently deliver it
  to readers with transparent on-access format migration. [www.lockss.org]'
