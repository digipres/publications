abstract: 'The format of a digital object must be known in order to interpret the
  information content of that object properly. Strong format typing is therefore fundamental
  to the effective use, interchange, and preservation of all digitally-encoded content.
  In terms of the OAIS reference model, format typing is a component of an object''s
  representation information. Formats themselves also have representation information--primarily,
  the set of syntactic and semantic rules for encoding content into digital form--that
  must be preserved to address the concern raised by the Library of Congress''s recent
  planning report, Preserving Our Digital Heritage: "Longevity of digital data and
  the ability to read those data in the future depend upon standards for encoding
  and describing, but standards change over time." The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation
  has funded an effort by the Harvard University Library to create a Global Digital
  Format Registry (GDFR) that will provide preservation practitioners with sustainable
  services to store, discover, and deliver representation information about digital
  formats. This presentation will provide an update on GDFR project activities.'
