abstract: The U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO) is committed to ensuring permanent
  public access and preservation of U.S. Federal publications. Historically, preservation
  of the tangible materials has been handled in collaboration with the individual
  libraries participating in the Federal Depository Library Program. Advances in information
  dissemination and the need to preserve digital content has necessitated changes
  in processes associated with GPO's production and distribution of Federal publications.
  Working with U.S. Government agencies, depository libraries and other interested
  parties, GPO is moving to implement a life-cycle approach to publishing of Federal
  publications to ensure not only access, but preservation of the objects for the
  future. This presentation will focus on GPO's collaboration with other communities
  of practice and the development of FDsys, GPO's digital content management system.
