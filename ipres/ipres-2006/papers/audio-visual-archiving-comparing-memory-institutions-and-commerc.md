abstract: 'This presentation will compare and contrast the audio-visual reformatting
  carried out in memory institutions with the production, distribution, and archiving
  of born digital content by record labels, television broadcasters, and motion picture
  producers. For sound recordings, digital practices have been established in both
  memory institutions and the industry, although issues regarding multi-track productions
  are troublesome for the industry. For video, digital approaches are widely used
  for reformatting by libraries and for new broadcast production, but most video masters
  continue to be recorded on conventional digital videotape rather than as media-independent
  digital file formats. For theatrical films, most memory institutions continue to
  reformat using proven photo-chemical approaches.  Meanwhile, the production of new
  theatrical films is genuinely hybrid: Hollywood''s current workflow mixes digital
  and film-based stages and elements. It is also the case, however, that high costs
  and the lack of relevant standards prevent motion picture producers from identifying
  and implementing a clear-cut digital solution for the long-term archiving of their
  valuable production assets. In all three areas--sound, video, and cinema--memory
  institutions and the industry face similar problems. Will they find ways to share
  their investigations and develop common solutions?'
