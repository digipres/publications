abstract: The hard sciences have worked for many years towards global collaboration
  on an infrastructural and workflow level. The concepts and technologies eveloped
  in this venture are increasingly being adopted by other disciplines including the
  social sciences or the arts and humanities. In Europe these disciplines aim to establish
  an integrated e-Science landscape to benefit from the existing resources and experiences
  attained by the "hard sciences". Current humanities projects under the e-Science
  umbrella are on a promising route. The preservation community could benefit greatly
  from the e-science community in the strive for - amongst other - sharing storage
  resources while maintaining local autonomy; interoperability and resource integration
  on a semantic level; adaptability for long-term stability; sharing services and
  synchronising workflows. As part of its mission as a national coalition for digital
  preservation, Nestor II aims to network the e-Science and preservation communities
  and further the transfer of concepts and tools between them.
