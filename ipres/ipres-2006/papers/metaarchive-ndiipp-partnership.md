abstract: 'The MetaArchive of Southern Digital Culture will discuss the first two
  years of deliverables (2004-2006) for their three year partnership for establishing
  a collaborative digital preservation network for southern cultural heritage materials.
  The MetaArchive of Southern Culture is a multi-institutional partner with the Library
  of Congress in their National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation
  Program (NDIIPP) and has established a distributed model for digital preservation.
  Headed by Emory University, this test-bed implementation network involves six different
  academic research libraries (Auburn University, Emory University, Georgia Institute
  of Technology, Florida State University, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
  University, University of Louisville) as well as a strategic alliance with the Stanford
  University based LOCKSS Program and the Library of Congress.

  During the first two years of this project the MetaArchive partnership has implemented
  a collaborative digital preservation network, has tested the LOCKSS toolset for
  scale (3 terabytes), for ingest (HTTP and OAI-PMH), and for reliability (total system
  failure). The group has also developed a collection-level conspectus that inter-operates
  with LOCKSS ingest plug-ins and collection selection policies of the group. Included
  in this presentation will be a discussion of the collaborative partnership agreements
  and the forthcoming work on the next phases of the project which include establishing
  a non-profit entity that specializes in digital preservation networks for cultural
  heritage institutions, creating a formalized business model to advance our collaborative
  paradigm outside of our Library of Congress partnership, to conduct document format
  tests involving LOCKSS on-access migration and batch migration strategies, and to
  implement a preservation management framework that incorporates other open-source
  preservation software tools capable of integrating with our current LOCKSS-based
  network.'
