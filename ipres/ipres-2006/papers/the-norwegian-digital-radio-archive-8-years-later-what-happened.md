abstract: The Norwegian Broadcast Corporation (NRK, www.nrk.no) and the National Library
  of Norway has for six years been working together to digitise the historical radio
  archive of NRK. The project aims at preservation, professional re-use, and general
  access. More than 50.000 hrs (170.000 programs) have now been digitised in high
  quality. The archive is built within the National Library of Norway, but serves
  as the every-day radio archive for NRK with their headquarters 1000 kms away. The
  archive is also now the repository where the National Library of Norway stores copies
  of the daily radio broadcast in Norway, enabling the archive to be updated on a
  daily basis. The archive is also integrated with FEIDE (www.feide.no), a federated
  authentication regime for the research and education sector in Norway. Based on
  the use of FEIDE, the National Library of Norway has established a role-based access
  control for the archive.
