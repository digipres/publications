abstract: 'Electronic journals dominate the field of academic literature, and it is
  of great importance to the international scientific community that this electronic
  intellectual output remains accessible in perpetuity. It is uncertain, however,
  whether the traditional model, based on national deposits and geographical frontiers,
  will be able to guarantee the long-term safety of the international academic output
  in a digital form. Academic literature is produced by multinational publishers,
  and has often no longer a country of origin that can be easily identified and thus
  no obvious guardian. Hence, in the traditional model there is a huge risk of academic
  records being lost forever. A systematic and more concentrated approach is needed
  to address this unacceptable risk. In this presentation we discuss the policy and
  ambitions of the National Library of the Netherlands (Koninklijke Bibliotheek, KB)
  regarding digital archiving of electronic publications. We discuss three possible
  threats against permanent access, and we propose a coordinated and systematic approach
  to address these risks: the Safe Places Network. This paper also includes a comprehensive
  overview of the e-Depot system and the KB approaches to digital preservation.'
