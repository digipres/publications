abstract: 'Preservation metadata requirements for repositories: a project of the Australian
  Partnership for Sustainable Repositories (APSR) -- APSR aims to establish a centre
  of excellence in sustainable digital resource management and partner universities
  are developing demonstrator repositories built on sustainability principles. This
  paper presents the work of a project commissioned by APSR to specify requirements
  for the collection of metadata needed for long term continuity of access to digital
  collections. The project was called PRESTA (PREMIS Requirements Statement) but it
  took a broader view than PREMIS alone. The MetaArchive of Southern Digital Culture
  will discuss the first two years of deliverables (2004-2006) for their three year
  partnership for establishing a collaborative digital preservation network for southern
  cultural heritage materials.'
