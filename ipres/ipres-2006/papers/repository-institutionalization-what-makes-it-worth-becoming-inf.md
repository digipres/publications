abstract: 'Since the advent of inexpensive or open-source institutional repository
  software, libraries and other institutions have attempted to wrestle with delivering
  services that could justify supporting the repository through chargebacks of some
  kind; yet a major problem has been persuading people to fill the repositories with
  content of adequate value to prospective user communities. Since 2003 we have been
  running DSpace repository software in the School of Information, University of Texas
  at Austin, at first simply as a testbed for student work but since spring of 2005
  as an institutional archival repository. In the course of this experience, following
  the “seed-evolve-reseed” model developed by Gerhard Fischer at the University of
  Colorado for collaborative development of computing environments, we have begun
  to demonstrate the value of such a repository in several different directions: fulfilling
  the state of Texas statutory requirements for preserving official documents (in
  which the official version of administrative information is posted on the School’s
  website); providing faculty (and students) with preprint and postprint exposure
  of their work; providing secure storage for learning objects, including presentations
  and tutorials; providing secure archiving for digital materials of historical value
  both to the School and to the discipline; providing an environment for students
  to work on the problems of digital archiving, populated with objects that will over
  time and in their turn demonstrate further problems of digital archiving; and providing
  the Information Technology service with a secure archive for versions of installed
  software and content. These uses within the School alone are beginning to weigh
  securely enough in the balance to warrant commitment of funding for the provision
  of infrastructure to the tasks of administering and delivering educational services.'
