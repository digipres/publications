abstract: The UK scene -- David Thomas will focus on the Seamless Flow programme being
  undertaken at the National Archives of the UK. This is an ambitious plan to develop
  a fully comprehensive digital preservation service for the UK central government.
  It covers the selection of record for permanent preservation, their transfer to
  the National Archives and their storage, preservation and delivery to users. Crucially,
  the programme is doing work in two other spaces â€“ the intermediate storage of digital
  material which has a long-term business value to government (such as files relating
  to radioactive waste) and resource discovery. Many of the hard lessons learned on
  this challenging programme have a wider application and he will be sharing these
  with you.
