abstract: 'Astronomers are producing and analyzing data at ever more prodigious rates.
  NASA''s Great Observatories, ground-based national observatories, and major survey
  projects have archive and data distribution systems in place to manage their standard
  data products, and these are now interlinked through the protocols and metadata
  standards agreed upon in the Virtual Observatory. However, the digital data associated
  with peer-reviewed publications is only rarely archived. Most often, astronomers
  publish graphical representations of their data but not the data themselves. Other
  astronomers cannot readily inspect the data to either confirm the interpretation
  presented in a paper or extend the analysis. Highly processed data sets reside on
  departmental servers and the personal computers of astronomers, and may or may not
  be available a few years hence. We are investigating ways to preserve and curate
  the digital data associated with peer-reviewed journals in astronomy. The technology
  and standards of the VO provide one component of the necessary technology. A variety
  of underlying systems can be used to physically host a data repository, and indeed
  this repository need not be centralized. The repository, however, must be managed
  and data must be documented through high quality, curated metadata. Multiple access
  portals must be available: the original journal, the host data center, the Virtual
  Observatory, or any number of topically-oriented data services utilizing VO-standard
  access mechanisms.'
