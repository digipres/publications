abstract: We are at a point where the scope, definition, and uses of digital libraries
  and institutional repositories are changing along with the process of creating and
  disseminating scholarly and scientific information.   It is not enough to just store
  documents, datasets, images, and other resources in repositories where they can
  be searched and accessed.   The networked landscape in which we live inspires more
  and calls upon us to develop information architectures that promote (1) the creation
  of complex digital objects that consist of both local and remote content, (2) the
  ability to interconnect digital objects that reside in distributed repositories,
  (3) the ability to re-use objects or their components in the creation of new resources.  All
  of these requirements have implications for how we build digital libraries, repositories,
  and scholarly information systems in the future, and they also present significant
  challenges for digital preservation. In this talk I will discuss how the Fedora
  Project is approaching the digital preservation problem. In particular, I will highlight
  key aspects of the Fedora repository system and service framework that are preservation-enabling.
  I will also review current work undertaken by the Fedora Project in collaboration
  with the Fedora Preservation Working Group. This work entails the use of message-oriented
  middleware to facilitate alerting of preservation-noteworthy events and the development
  of services to respond to such events.
