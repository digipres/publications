abstract: Establishing a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness and trustworthiness
  of a digital repository requires a broad range of evidence. Preservation can be
  considered as a complex spatial and chronological network of challenges, and associated
  risks. For example the organisational, financial, technological and operational
  contexts within which a repository resides and the extent to which it is capable
  of managing them must be ascertained if an audit is to be able to assert the likelihood
  of the institution's success. Significant effort must be directed towards the definition
  of methodologies for identifying appropriate classes of evidence, to their evaluation,
  and to the attaching of weight to them. Formal means are required to facilitate
  the analysis and comparison of disparate evidence types in order to enable auditors
  to accommodate a diverse range of physical, testimonial and experiment-based proof.
  In addition to binary systems of inquiry (e.g., does the organisation have a mission
  statement?) auditors must display an ability to distinguish the most persuasive
  examples from those that provide less substantive evidence of organisational competence.
  Similarly, if, for instance, a significant proportion of staff reveal that they
  have no idea of the content of their organisation's mission statement then this
  must be reflected in the overall organisational assessment. A comprehensive insight,
  and consequent decision, can only be reached after fully exploring the evidential
  basis upon which compliance is to be founded. This discussion of evidential appraisal
  techniques for repository audit reflects the series of pilot audits undertaken by
  the Digital Curation Centre within a selection of UK data centres and archives,
  including the Beazley Archive and the British Atmospheric Data Centre.
