abstract: Capturing OAIS defined representation information in a standardised way
  is critical for the preservation and future reuse of scientific data. The structure
  of a scientific data object needs to be defined so that a future user can map the
  data bits to the actual scientific data. The semantics associated with the scientific
  data also needs to be defined so that the data can be understood and used by a user
  from the appropriate designated community. This presentation will show how simple
  scientific digital objects (tables, images etc.) can be described and "virtualised"
  by using representation information in the form of EAST file format descriptions
  (structure) and the corresponding DEDSL data dictionaries (semantics). It will also
  be shown that in some real life cases the EAST and DEDSL standards need to be extended
  so that they can fully describe the simple objects. Tools and APIs will be demonstrated
  that take the structure and semantic definitions for a simple scientific digital
  object and automatically read the data it contains and render it in the appropriate
  way.
