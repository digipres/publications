abstract: For almost two years, the National Library of New Zealand (NLNZ), Endeavor
  Information Systems and Sun Microsystems have been working together to design and
  implement a comprehensive digital preservation platform for New Zealand's National
  Digital Heritage Archive. NLNZ has developed the requirements for the platform and
  with Endeavor is completing the specifications. From that, Endeavor is building
  a components-based application platform (called Kronos) and Sun is developing the
  overall reference architecture. A goal for all three organizations is to create
  a solution that is generic and applicable for any library with large and varied
  types of digital content. An independent peer review group has periodically met
  with the three organizations to ensure that the Kronos design is widely applicable
  to other libraries and complies with international standards. Our presentation describes
  why the partnerships formed and how they have evolved. The concept of the Peer Review
  Group will be examined as a method of ensuring industry-wide compliance and as a
  mechanism for explicating and resolving tension between partners.
