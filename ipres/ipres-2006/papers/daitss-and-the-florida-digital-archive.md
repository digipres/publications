abstract: '    The Florida Digital Archive (FDA) is a digital preservation repository
  run by the Florida Center for Library Automation (FCLA) for the use of the eleven
  public universities of Florida. The FDA went into production in November 2005. It
  ingested 108,607 files (2.2 TB) in the first 6 months of operation. The FDA uses
  a locally developed software application called DAITSS to support the repository
  functions of ingest, data management and dissemination, and the preservation functions
  of format normalization and format migration. Functionally, DAITSS consists of a
  set of services. The Ingest Service performs format validation, extraction of technical
  metadata, creation of derivative files through normalization and/or migration, and
  storage preparation. Storage Maintenance assures that stored masters remain good
  copies on readable media. The Access Service is responsible for access control,
  reporting, and building Dissemination Information Packages in response to requests.
  Other services include Withdrawal and Repository Management. The system does not
  support discovery functions for end-users or real-time online access to archived
  materials. It can, however, be used as a preservation back-end to institutional
  repositories, publishing systems, digital libraries, or other user oriented applications.
  Following the OAIS reference model, DAITSS assumes a community of Producers who
  select, prepare and submit materials for preservation. In the FDA context, these
  are the libraries of the public universities of Florida, which have negotiated archiving
  agreements with the repository. To date, most submissions have been preservation
  masters from local digitization projects, and electronic theses and dissertations
  (ETDs). This presentation will give an overview of the Florida Digital Archive and
  the underlying DAITSS application, which is targeted for release as Open Source
  Software in 2006.'
