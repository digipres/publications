abstract: "File format obsolescence is a major risk factor threatening the sustainability
  of and access to digital information. While the preservation community has become
  increasingly interested in tools for migration and transformation of file formats,
  the National Library of Australia is developing mechanisms specifically focused
  on monitoring and assessing the risks of file format obsolescence. This paper reports
  on the AONS II project, undertaken by the National Library of Australia (NLA) in
  conjunction with the Australian Partnership for Sustainable Repositories (APSR).
  The project aimed to develop a software tool which allows users to automatically
  monitor the status of file formats in their repositories, make risk assessments
  based on a core set of obsolescence risk questions, and receive notifications when
  file format risks change or other related events occur. \nThis paper calls for the
  preservation community to develop a co-operating file format obsolescence community
  which includes registries, software tool creators and end users to effectively curate
  digital content in order to maintain long-term access."
