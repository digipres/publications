abstract: 'This paper proposes steps towards a roadmap for improving the integration
  of two communities that deal with persistence and long-term stewardship of digital
  content. They are Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) and Digital Preservation. Both disciplines
  have made significant progress and practical contributions. Yet their approaches
  are not fully linked and there is considerable potential to integrate their solution
  space and to improve either of them by learning from the other. It addresses three
  core issues:

  1. How does the long-term digital object life-cycle affect PIDs, the entities they
  identify, and the metadata that describes them?

  2. How can PIDs help long-term preservation?

  3. How can long-term preservation help to shape PID best practice and ensure long-term
  access to the scholarly record?

  We also sketch out initial results of our ongoing work along this roadmap.'
