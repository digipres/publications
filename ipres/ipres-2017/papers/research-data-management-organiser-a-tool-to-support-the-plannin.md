abstract: 'The project Research Data Management Organiser (RDMO)1 develops a tool
  to support the planning, implementation and organisation of research data management.
  The multilingual open source tool can be installed locally and adapted to institutional
  or discipline-specific needs with regards to contents. It provides interfaces to
  institutional authentication procedures. Key features of the first version, released
  in April 2017, include: the ability to continuously update and augment the information
  in the course of a project; access for different stakeholders, such as researchers,
  project coordinators, the IT department, data managers etc., with customized views;
  export formats for different purposes including data management plans (DMPs) according
  to funder requirements.

  Planned future developments include, among other things, features to support actual
  data management, e.g. tasks (with deadlines and a reminder functionality) that can
  be linked with dedicated stakeholder responsibilities.'
