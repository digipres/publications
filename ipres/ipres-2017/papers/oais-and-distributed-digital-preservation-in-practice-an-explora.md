abstract: 'The aim of the paper is to illustrate how the distributed aspects of digital
  preservation can be aligned in practice, with the concepts and principles of the
  Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model.

  There has been a growing awareness within the digital preservation community of
  the need for cooperation between organizations to address digital preservation requirements.
  One common example is that replicas of preservation copies of digital objects need
  to be independently preserved (e.g., stored, managed, monitored, documented) to
  ensure that at least one correct replica will survive for as long as needed. Such
  independence can be achieved through distributed digital preservation that relies
  upon specific agreements between participating and contributing organizations. The
  OAIS Reference Model does not address the challenges of distributed digital preservation
  in detail, though it acknowledges the potential benefits and the options.

  A model in form of an extension to the OAIS Reference Model was developed by a Danish
  bit repository project, as there was an urgent need for such a model. This model
  has evolved to the Outer OAIS–Inner OAIS (OO-IO) Model through the international
  project “Framework for Applying the OAIS Reference Model to Distributed Digital
  Preservation”. Previous papers have presented the theoretical basis for the OO-IO
  model as a model to describe distributed digital preservation systems in a way that
  conforms to the OAIS Reference Model, but practical examples of applying the model
  have been sparse.

  This paper provides detailed descriptions of how the need for the OO-IO model emerged,
  how it has been used for both design and audit of the Danish bit repository, how
  we plan to use it for minimal effort ingest, and what other use cases there are
  for applying the OO-IO model for distributed digital preservation purposes. This
  will illustrate how using the OO-IO model can assist in the analysis of complex
  digital preservation tasks of a distributed OAIS-conformant repository, where the
  OO-IO model provides terminology and contribute to break down analysis and audit
  questions.'
