abstract: Metadata about digital objects help users find, understand, use and reuse
  those objects. Longevity of digital objects is a vital issue for digital preservation,
  which means that the metadata about digital objects must be maintained as well,
  so that their content and meaning should be maintained over time. Open Archival
  Information System (OAIS) defines three metadata components, which have to be maintained
  with Digital Object â€“ Representation Information of Digital Object, Preservation
  Description Information (PDI) in an Information Package, and the Content Information
  given to every Information Package. Provenance of a digital object, which is one
  of the five categories of PDI, is a crucial record of the history of the object
  over its lifecycle. Since metadata are exchanged as digital objects on the Web,
  machine-readable and interoperable provenance description of metadata is required
  for the long- term maintenance of metadata. This paper presents issues in the longevity
  of metadata, especially the issue of metadata provenance based on the Singapore
  Framework for Dublin Core Application Profiles (DCAP), which is well known for metadata
  interoperability in the networked information environment. The paper first briefly
  discusses features of metadata as first class objects on the Web. Then, we address
  potential risks in affecting interpretability of digital objects and issues in the
  consistent maintenance of metadata. Next, the W3C PROV standard for general provenance
  description and Resource Description Framework (RDF) for metadata exchange on the
  Web are adopted as the base models for provenance description of metadata. We developed
  simple provenance description models for formal provenance description for both
  structural features and vocabularies of metadata. The models are designed based
  on Entities and Activities defined by the W3C PROV in correspondence with primitive
  changes of metadata application profiles and metadata vocabularies, respectively.
  We also provide formal provenance description examples corresponding to structural
  changes in a metadata application profile along with semantic changes in the use
  of its metadata vocabulary. We discuss limitations of our proposed models and review
  provenance related research. Finally, the main findings of this research are summarized
  in the conclusions.
