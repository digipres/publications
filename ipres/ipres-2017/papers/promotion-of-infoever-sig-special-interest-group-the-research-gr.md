abstract: Advancements in information science technology are generating anticipations
  of a “super smart society” that integrates the physical and cyber worlds. A research
  group that discusses the grand design for a long-term digital information preservation
  system that can respond to the super smart society from the perspectives of information
  science, materials science and social science is being promoted. The group started
  its activities on March 2016, and has completed the first phase on March 2017 by
  conducting a basic survey. For 2017, the research group will continue on to the
  second phase by specifically deciding on the targets for digital preservation and
  their methods, and then propose strategies on the long-term preservation of digital
  information in the super smart society in 2018.
