abstract: A large number of bibliographic data and images of Japanese historical rare
  books have been published on the Web. For constructing structured bibliographic
  data, such as in a format of Linked Data, the data providers need to extract structured
  information from notes of the bibliography, which are written in Japanese natural
  texts with domain-specific terms. These jobs have been usually performed by persons
  with special knowledge. In this paper, the authors propose a semi-automated method
  to convert natural texts in real bibliographic data into Linked Data. As a part
  of the method, a simple ontology of key elements (named entities) in bibliographic
  data is constructed along general bibliographic rules for historical heritage. The
  ontology also has a capability to describe relations between a book and its parts.
  This allows mechanical access to information such as a creator of a cover picture,
  preface and so on. Finally, a script creates connections from named entities to
  URIs which describe headings or glossaries provided online by public organizations.
