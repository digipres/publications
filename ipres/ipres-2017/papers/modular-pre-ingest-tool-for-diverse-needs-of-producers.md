abstract: We introduce an open-source pre-ingest tool that assists the generation
  of Submission Information Packages (SIPs) that are to be submitted to the national
  digital preservation service in Finland. The pre-ingest tool consists of several
  independent components that produce the parts of a METS document required by the
  national preservation service. These components are easy to modify when developing
  services for different user demands or for different repositories. Users of the
  tool provide the necessary information as parameters for the tool, which produces
  the structure and descriptions for the SIP. The pre-ingest tool reduces the need
  to deeply understand either METS, PREMIS or other metadata formats to be able to
  preserve digital assets.
