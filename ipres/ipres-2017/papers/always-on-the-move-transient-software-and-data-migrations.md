abstract: 'Software is transient: itâ€™s the data that matter. Anyone who works with
  software understands that applications come and go, and even those that last many
  years go through numerous upgrades and re-architectures as they try to keep up with
  the latest technological advances. This flux creates a problem: how do we efficiently
  move our data through changing software and version upgrades as losslessly as possible?
  The Fedora community recently confronted this problem, which led to the development
  of a tool that could have broad utility for data migrations.

  Fedora is a flexible, extensible, open source repository platform for managing,
  preserving, and providing access to digital content. Fedora has gone through several
  major version upgrades since its initial conception almost 20 years ago, most recently
  with the move to Fedora 4. Fedora 4 is a complete software re-architecture, which
  necessitates a data migration from previous versions of Fedora. This experience
  led the Fedora community to focus on making it as easy as possible to get data into
  and out of Fedora in standard formats, an effort that culminated in the creation
  of an import/export utility that standardizes on RDF and the BagIt specification
  to transfer data between versions of Fedora as well as external preservation systems.
  This effort coincides with a recently chartered Research Data Alliance working group
  with a mandate to explore technologies and standards for interoperability between
  repository platforms and make recommendations on this topic. The group is exploring
  the Fedora import/export utility as a possible basis for broader interoperability
  between diverse repository platforms by building on this standard import/export
  functionality. This paper will provide an overview of the import/export efforts
  that have taken place so far, and discuss how we might achieve broader interoperability
  and ease data migrations through the work of the RDA Research Data Repository Interoperability
  working group.'
