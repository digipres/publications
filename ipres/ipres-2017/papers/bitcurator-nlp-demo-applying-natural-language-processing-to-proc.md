abstract: 'We will demonstrate products of the BitCurator NLP project, which is developing
  software for LAMs to extract and expose features (e.g. people, places, organizations,
  events, relationships, topics) in text extracted from born-digital materials. The
  services and methods can be used by LAM professionals for appraisal and description,
  as well as facilitating a wider range of access and use scenarios.
