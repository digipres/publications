abstract: 'Cross-domain collaboration lies at the heart of approach of the Dutch Coalition
  for Digital Preservation (NCDD) [1]. Sharing re- sponsibilities, knowledge and infrastructures
  is an absolute neces- sity for the realisation of high-quality, effective and efficient
  digital archive- and information management.

  In November 2016, the NCDD research on the construction of a cross-domain network
  of facilities for long-term access to digital Cultural Heritage in the Netherlands
  was rewarded the Digital Preservation Award 2016 in the category Research and Innovation
  [2]. According to the judges the research report presents an out- standing model
  to help memory institutes to share facilities and create a distributed, nationwide
  infrastructure network for Digital Preservation.

  This model describes a network of collaborative facilities as a back bone for sharing
  facilities within the Netherlands. It describes all the elements of an infrastructure
  for digital preservation. Not only the technical parts of it, but also its organisational,
  legal and finan- cial parts. Describing them as elements, building-blocks, helps
  us to understand them and to get a better picture of what is already available on
  the one hand, and the demand on the other hand. One should notice that this model
  is based on the most desirable infra- structure. It describes the broad picture
  and enables us to create a roadmap towards the desirable situation. As always, the
  proof of the pudding is in the eating. This paper describes the theory behind the
  model and the steps to put the model into practice in an opera- tional sense.
