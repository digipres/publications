abstract: The field of digital archiving is situated in a tenuous position between
  the archives and information technology, where the humanity of archival labor is
  often erased on one side and that of users may be ill-considered on the other. To
  that end, the quality of technical documentation is paramount to the success of
  digital archiving efforts, but it often falls victim to a lack of empathy for practitioners,
  users of our tools and collections, and those represented in the archives. This
  paper aims to provide initial community suggestions for creating better, more useful
  documentation built around the concept of empathy.
