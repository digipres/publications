abstract: 'Biodiversity essentially describes all living organisms and their environments.
  As the world’s most comprehensive digital library collection of legacy biodiversity
  literature, the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) is dedicated to building and
  maintaining their repository by determining the scope of biodiversity literature
  and analyzing the collection strengths, weaknesses and gaps in the BHL corpus [1].
  Regular analyses have been performed since the creation of BHL in 2006 and as the
  corpus expands and methods for analyzing literature in the public domain develop,
  continuous analysis of BHL coverage and gaps remains critical. In the course of
  2017, BHL has the opportunity to work with a team of National Digital Stewardship
  Residents who are committed to developing a plan for the next generation of BHL.

  This poster will illustrate the current research and progress of the collection
  analysis project of the National Digital Stewardship Resident (NDSR) project led
  by the resident hosted at the Chicago Botanic Garden’s Lenhardt Library.'
