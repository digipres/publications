abstract: This paper describes the design and pilot of a digital preservation training
  needs assessment at Bodleian Libraries (University of Oxford). The assessment was
  designed to establish training needs among staff, with the purpose of creating targeted
  digital preser- vation training based on gaps identified. Measurements for the assessment
  were developed around the DigCurV [7] Framework skill descriptors combined with
  a literature review of other skills frameworks. The measurements were developed
  into a set of inter- view questions, which was piloted on nine members of staff
  from the Oxford University Research Archive (ORA) in the winter of 2016. Findings
  from the assessment have influenced the design of training modules which frame digital
  preservation concepts around workflows in the ORA digital repository. The modules
  take as their starting point the awareness level, knowledge, practical skills, problem
  solving approaches and preferred learning style of staff within the ORA team.
