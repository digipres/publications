abstract: Members of the digital preservation community collate and cap-ture metadata
  to describe file formats, software, operating systemsand hardware, and use it to
  inform and drive digital preservationprocesses. In this work we describe how the
  infrastructure ofWikidata meets the requirements for a technical registry of meta-data
  related to computer software and computing environments.Collaboratively creating
  this metadata, and making it available aslinked open data, will reduce the amount
  of redundant work digitalpreservation professionals do in order to describe resources.
  Hav-ing machine-readable, linked open data that describes the digitalpreservation
  domain will also allow us to reuse this data in our soft-ware applications and information
  systems, reducing the overheadwhen building new tools. Furthermore the Wikidata
  social andtechnical infrastructure will enable the long term continued accessto
  the data digital preservation practitioners collate and capture.Wikidata is a project
  of the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF), andis created through commons-based peer production
  [3]. Simplyput, Wikidata is a knowledge base of structured data that anyonecan edit
  [40]. The infrastructure of Wikidata is created using freesoftware, and is designated
  to the public domain. All content inWikidata is licensed so that other may freely
  reuse the data. Vol-unteer editors, coordinating their own work, add data to Wikidata.Through
  this analysis we demonstrate how the infrastructure ofWikidata provides distinct
  advantages to the cultural heritage do-main that proprietary knowledge bases do
  not provide.
