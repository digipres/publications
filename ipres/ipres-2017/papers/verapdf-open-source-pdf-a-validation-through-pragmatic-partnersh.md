abstract: veraPDF is an open source industry-supported PDF/A conformance checker developed
  by the members of the veraPDF consortium. The software validates all current parts
  and conformance levels of ISO 19005 (PDF/A[1]). This paper makes the case for open
  source format validation and describes the projectâ€™s approach to building and testing
  the software. It also explores how the unique partnership between cultural heritage
  organisations and PDF industry has created an active open source community.
