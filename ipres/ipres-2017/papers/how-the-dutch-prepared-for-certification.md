abstract: 'As  part  of  the  national  strategy  for  Cultural  Heritage  in  the
  Netherlands, under the umbrella of the Network Cultural Heritage (Dutch    acronym:    NDE),
  a working    group    consisting    of representative digital preservationists from
  different large  (mainly cultural   heritage)   organizations   worked   to   contribute   to   the
  certification process of their organizations. This paper describes the various  activities  of  the  working  group  that  resulted  in  a  well-balanced
  approach for certification based on (1) a phased approach, (2) a supporting tool
  for maturity level checking (3) translations of the DSA and DIN/ nestor guidelines
  into Dutch, (4) lessons learnt based  on  a  survey  amongst  DSA  certificate  holders,  (5)  training
  materials in Dutch.'
