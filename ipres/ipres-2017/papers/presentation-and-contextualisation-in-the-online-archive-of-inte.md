abstract: This poster presents the initial findings of a collaborative practice-based
  PhD research project at London South Bank University (London, UK) and Rhizome (New
  York, US). The project analyses challenges associated with presenting and contextualising
  internet art1 in an online archive through the lens of user interaction design.
  Using methods from human computer interaction (HCI) and user experience design,
  the project proposes a new design framework for the ArtBase, Rhizomeâ€™s online archive
  of internet art.
