abstract: We present an architecture for a trustworthy and portableemulation platform
  designed to protect the confidentialityand integrity of sensitive born-digital content
  when executedon a fundamentally untrustworthy platform. In evidence, wepresent a
  modified GameBoy emulator which is executableon a remote user platform while simultaneously
  protectingthe contents of game ROM files. In a more general applica-tion, an archive
  or a library might use such an emulationarchitecture to control access to restricted
  material on moresophisticated computer emulators.Our solution relies on Intelâ€™s
  Software Guard Extensions(SGX) technology for implementation of the trusted emu-lation
  environment. Access to sensitive data is protectedby server controlled encryption
  keys accessible only withinthe protected execution environment. This enables securecaching
  of encrypted data on the untrusted user platform foruse by the emulator and hence
  limits the potential perfor-mance issues originated from remote execution over Internetconnections.
