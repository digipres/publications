abstract: In this poster, we discuss the topic of preserving a cultural institution’s
  social media for cultural knowledge. We review approaches associated with preserving
  social media and apply this analysis by examining Asian Film Archive’s attempt at
  this. We also look at issues and challenges that have surfaced, as well as offer
  recommendations in response.
