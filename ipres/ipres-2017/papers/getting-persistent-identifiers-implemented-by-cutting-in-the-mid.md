abstract: "The Persistent Identifier (PID) project of the Dutch Digital Heritage Network
  (DHN) promotes sustainable access in the cultural heritage domain by stimulating
  the use of PIDs as references to (digital) cultural heritage objects. PIDs are long-
  lasting references to objects and offer a solution for link rot, which often results
  in 404 or Not Found error messages.\nCultural heritage organisations, regardless
  of size, are often hesitant to implement PIDs in their systems. They lack knowledge
  of PIDs, are unaware of the capabilities and benefits of PIDs, and fear possible
  complex and costly implementation processes as well as the maintenance costs for
  sustained services.\nTo address these issues, the DHN PID project focussed on:\n
  Raising awareness of (the importance of) PIDs in cultural heritage organisations,\n
  Increasing knowledge regarding the use of PIDs within cultural heritage,\n Supporting
  the technical implementation of PIDs in cultural heritage collection management
  systems.\nAt the time of writing, four vendors have implemented PIDs in the collection
  management systems (CMS) they provide1, and a dozen cultural heritage institutions
  are taking part in this pilot implementation phase. More importantly however, is
  that through these CMS vendors, PIDs have become more available and affordable as
  a sustainable long term access solution for hundreds of institutional digital collections
  and their users. To ensure that the information, training and education the project
  provided about PIDs can be disseminated and used as widely as possible, the project
  created (best practice) documentation in Dutch and English, along with a unique
  PID Guide for learning about PIDs and taking the first steps towards selecting a
  suitable PID solution, along with a PID implementation Roadmap. This was an effort
  to encourage the adoption and use of PIDs in the cultural heritage domain, by utilising
  their existing collection management system vendors.\nThe concept of ‘cutting in
  the middle-man’ – cooperating with collection management system vendors and supporting
  the implementation of PIDs in their products – has proven extremely successful,
  and the outcomes of this project may help cultural heritage initiatives in other
  countries to get PIDs implemented in their organisations too."
