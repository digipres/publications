abstract: 'The New York Public Library has created over 1.5 PB of files from digitizing
  over 50,000 audio and video items for the long-term preservation of their content.
  This paper details the Libraryâ€™s usage of the BagIt File Packaging Format during
  Quality Assurance and Audit Submissions functions as defined by OAIS. It also discusses
  extensions of the bagit-python library in order repair bags that do not pass those
  functions.

  Working with thousands of terabytes stored in hundreds of thou- sands of bags requires
  that our approaches to ingest scale appro- priately. Common changes to bags such
  as the accidental creation of system files in bags or purposeful edits of metadata
  files will invalidate the entire bag. Noting and responding to these errors is critical
  for improving workflows, but manual response is impos- sible. Using the bagit-python
  library, NYPL has created tools to selectively clean system files from bag directories
  and manifests, update or add checksums, and create event logs of repairs.'
