abstract: This paper describes the effort to develop an institutional strategy for
  digital assets management for the University of Notre Dame, where information is
  currently managed within a devolved organisational structure, and archiving and
  preservation are often overlooked. It advocates a lifecycle approach of digital
  assets management and recommends a strategy with the goal to embed considerations
  for archiving and preservation in policies, workflows and technologies across the
  entire organisation.
