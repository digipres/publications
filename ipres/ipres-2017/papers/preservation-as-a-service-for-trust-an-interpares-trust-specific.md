abstract: Questions regarding trust and authenticity of records stored in the Cloud,
  as well as the custodial obligations and storage management provided by the service
  provider of Internet-based records have yet to be resolved; but the adoption of
  Cloud-based technologies is not waiting for legislation or standards to resolve
  these issues. Therefore, there is an existing need clearly articulated requirements
  that provide effective, tested methods for documenting and maintaining the authenticity
  of records that are removed from creatorâ€™s systems and placed into the custody and
  control of Cloud Service Providers. To address this need, Preservation as a Service
  for Trust (PaaST), part of the InterPARES Trust research project, is modelling a
  suite of preservation services that detail specific actions and attributes that
  capture, create or document metadata and activities that provide supporting evidence
  of the authenticity of records entrusted to the Cloud Service Providers.
