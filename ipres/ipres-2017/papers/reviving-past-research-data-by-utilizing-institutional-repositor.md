abstract: A  considerable  number  of  databases  created  through Japanese public
  research funds are now under unstable management    or    use    an    outdated    publication
  methodology;  therefore,  future  access  to  the research results these databases
  contain cannot be guaranteed. Here,  we  examined  the  current  status  of  databases
  listed   in   two   major   sources,   Grant-in-Aid-funded databases  and  the  National  Diet  Library  Database
  Navigation   Service   (Dnavi),   and   reaffirmed   this problematic  situation.  To  ensure  the  sustainability  of
  these  databases,  the  Research  Data  Task  Force  of  the Japan    Consortium    for    Open    Access    Repository
  (JPCOAR)  is  currently  testing  a  workflow  for  the transfer   of   contents   from   unstable   databases   to
  institutional repositories.
