abstract: This poster is about one of the deliverables of the Polonsky Foundation-
  funded Digital Preservation at Oxford and Cambridge Project (DPOC), which is to
  assess the digital preservation skills and training needs within each institutionâ€™s
  workforce. During the review process of existing digital preservation skills and
  competencies it was found that there was no auditing template to use or adapt; as
  a result, the DigCurV competencies were reviewed and adapted into a toolkit to enable
  each institution to measure digital preservation knowledge and skill sets. For the
  DPOC Project, the results from the completed elements of the toolkit would enable
  the Fellows to identify poten- tial skill and knowledge gaps in order to develop
  in-house curricula. For the wider community, the toolkit is intended as a resource
  for developing digital curation and preservation training programmes.
