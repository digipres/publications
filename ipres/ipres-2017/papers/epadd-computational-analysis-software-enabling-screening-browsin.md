abstract: ePADD is free and open-source computational analysis software facilitating
  screening, browsing, and access for historically and culturally significant email
  collections. The software incorporates techniques from computer science and computational
  linguistics, including natural language processing, named entity recognition, and
  other statistical machine learning- associated processes. In this paper, we explain
  how these processes enable ePADD to support the appraisal, processing, discovery,
  and delivery of email held by archival repositories and other memory institutions,
  filling an important role in the preservation of these materials.
