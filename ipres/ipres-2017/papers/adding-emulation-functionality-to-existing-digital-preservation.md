abstract: The emulation of obsolete hardware and software environments to enable information
  to be read, and to facilitate interaction in a way that simulates the original user
  experience, is a well- established part of digital preservation solutions. Excellent
  tools have been developed to work with emulators, but these have remained in the
  research domain rather than being able to be exploited at scale. This paper explores
  a real example of how an emulation framework has been added to existing digital
  preservation infrastructure. This integration has enabled information has been extracted
  from obsolete hardware, held in a digital preservation system at Yale University
  Library (YUL), and linked to an appropriate emulator (provided by the University
  of Freiburgâ€™s Emulation as a Service framework). All of this enables YUL to recreate
  the user experience of interacting with content using the original software quickly
  and easily whenever a user requests it. This integration offers the prospect of
  large scale emulation as a service linked to real preserved data that is in need
  of this approach and this paper will examine the next steps needed to make this
  a reality.
