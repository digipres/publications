abstract: 'As part of the two-year Polonsky digital preservation research project[21],
  the Bodleian Libraries (the University of Oxford) and Cambridge University Library
  (CUL) are researching and develop- ing requirements for digital-preservation-specific
  services. Part of the project concerns gathering technical requirements for long-
  term digital content repository systems; this has included reviewing our own infrastructures,
  surveying our digitized collections and existing repositories, visiting a number
  of other institutions and assessing software from various vendors.

  Our poster highlights the different challenges both institutions face with their
  current systems, the collaboration relating to au- diting and reporting software
  used, the work which has already completed, and what is planned for rest of 2017-2018.'
