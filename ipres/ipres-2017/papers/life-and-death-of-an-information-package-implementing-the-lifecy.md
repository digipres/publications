abstract: This paper aims to explain how the National Library of France(BnF) faced
  the question of the information lifecycle, during theimplementation of its digital
  preservation system, in the light ofthe experience it acquired managing and using
  this system, froma theoretical approach following the OAIS reference model to animplementation.
  It was understood very early that from a preser-vation point of view the management
  of subsequent Versions andEditions of an Information Package was a particularly
  sensitiveproblem akin to risks management. However it was thought at thetime that
  the system should be able to manage the lifecycle of anAIP (Archival Information
  Package) in a universal way that wouldbe valid whatever the package considered and
  the context. Theseideas quickly proved to be impractical and didn’t resist the testof
  reality. Some improvements were provided, while taking intoaccount the rest of the
  digital ecosystem of the BnF.
