abstract: 'Dunhuang Mogao Grottoes, a world cultural heritage originally built in
  the 4th century, has now 735 remaining grottoes. Since the 1990s, Dunhuang Academy
  has taken the lead in digitizing the architectural forms, statues and murals of
  the grottoes through non-contact data collection and optical measurement technology,
  so that Dunhuang resources can be fully protected digitally. Based on that, through
  “digital Dunhuang”, numerous images, videos, three-dimensional digital objects,
  research documents and archaeological information are collected to build a digital,
  integrated, large-scale mural resource library and a sharing guarantee system for
  Dunhuang digital resources, to further link with relevant international resources
  and support knowledge mining and intelligent services.
