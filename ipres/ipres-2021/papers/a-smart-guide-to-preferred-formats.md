abstract: 'The Dutch Digital Heritage Network has developed an online tool that helps
  archives and heritage organisations to formulate their policy on file formats. It
  builds a knowledge base, via a smart combination of codification of formats on one
  hand and personalisation of tailor made policies on the other. This paper will explain
  how the online tool is set up, what technologies it uses and what possible next
  steps might be in the near future.
