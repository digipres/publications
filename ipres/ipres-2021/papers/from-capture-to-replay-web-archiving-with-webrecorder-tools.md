abstract: "Web archiving can take many forms, but usually involves fully capturing
  websites, storing the captured content, and faithly reproducing, or replaying the
  archived sites. Since the web at its core consists of HTTP requests and responses,
  this process is often done at the HTTP traffic level to ensure full fidelity.\n\nTraditionally,
  as pioneered by the Internet Archive and others, capture has been done by a web
  crawler which would automatically ‘crawl’ sites by making HTTP requests and discovering
  new links.\n\nAnother approach is to capture content through the web browser itself,
  capturing content right before it gets to the browser (or even right after). This
  type of web archiving can be done by using the suite of open source tools to capture
  interactive websites and replay them at a later time as accurately as possible on
  one’s own computer. \n\nWebrecorder project builds tools that specialize in a ‘user-driven’
  form of web archiving, where the user is able to direct the archiving process through
  their browser. The goal of Webrecorder has been to build quality open source tools
  to enable ‘web archiving for all’ to allow anyone with a browser to create their
  own web archives, and to accurately replay them at a later time.\n\nWebrecorder
  project intends to support the creation of lots of small, decentralized archives
  by individuals and institutions. Rather than supporting a single centralized silo,
  a key goal remains to support web archives in a variety of environment and storage
  scenarios. From users’ personal laptops, to google drive, to IPFS, Webrecorder tools
  will be designed to support creating and accessing web archives wherever they may
  be found.\n\nThrough this workshop participants will gain a working knowledge on
  how web archiving works by using a simple web archiving process from capture to
  replay on a user’s local computer by using two open-source tools from Webrecorder:
  archiveweb.page and replayweb.page. \n\nArchiveweb.page is an open-source web archiving
  capture tool that turns your browser into a full-featured interactive web archiving
  system. It is available as an extension for any Chrome or Chromium based browsers
  and as a standalone app. \n\nReplayweb.page is an open-source browser-based viewer
  that loads web archive files provided by the user and renders them for replay in
  the browser. It functions as a serverless (client-side) web archive replay tool.\n\nBoth
  these tools combined create high-fidelity web archives using a basic workflow from
  capture to replay that participants can control, save, and embed onto other platforms.
  All the code can be viewed and accessed via the Webrecorder github: http://github.com/webrecorder/\n\nAttendees
  will benefit from this workshop by gaining the ability to create high fidelity captures
  to make collections that they’ll have full autonomy over and can manage on their
  own devices and services. This session includes step-by-step installation help for
  both archiveweb.page and replayweb.page from the Webrecorder team. There will be
  a tutorial on how to analyze the website before capturing pages as well as breakdown
  to better understand components of the practice of web archiving and explore how
  they can fit into existing and emerging digital preservation workflows.\n\nThe target
  audience members for this type of workshop include: researchers, archivists, librarians,
  other practitioners working with digital materials, and developers. No prior experience
  with web archiving will be required of attendees.\n"
