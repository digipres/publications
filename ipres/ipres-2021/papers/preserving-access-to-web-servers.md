abstract: 'With the advent of the so-called Web 2.0 technologies, web resources became
  the primary platform for internal and external collaboration, knowledge exchange,
  and self-publication. Many of these services cannot be fully preserved by solely
  relying on client-side technologies like crawlers. In particular, their dynamic
  and reactive character will be lost by generating static snapshots. In this article,
  we develop concepts and describe infrastructure built on emulation to address the
  problem of retiring obsolete web service infrastructure while keeping the service
  long-term accessible and usable. We show the practicability of this approach by
  the example of three use-cases from academic projects.
