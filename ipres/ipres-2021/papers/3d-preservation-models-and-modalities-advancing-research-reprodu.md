abstract: 'This paper presents findings from a multi-method study in archiving, accessing,
  and preserving 3D data. Specifically, we seek to develop a reusable and robust model
  for preserving and accessing 3D data. We further seek to identify links between
  digital triage, preservation actions, and archiving in multiple disciplines in order
  to make recommendations to embed data stewardship processes in research ecosystems.
  This work happens through interdisciplinary collaboration to validate curation practices
  across fields and disciplines.


  Numerous disciplines and sectors are producing 3D data for research and instruction,
  but without the guidance of published standards or practices generalizable across
  fields. This paper will present our findings from identifying researcher needs,
  preservation and access requirements, and metadata models for our 3D models of specimens
  from the Virginia Tech Entomology Department. Our outcomes are an evaluation of
  the output using quantitative and qualitative methods, a working 3D metadata schema
  for access and preservation, and an access platform for our 3D models.
