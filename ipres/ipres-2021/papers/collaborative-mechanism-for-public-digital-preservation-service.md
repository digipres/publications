abstract: 'National Digital Preservation Program is built as a public service of,
  by, and for the national library community, and a trustworthy partner in the chain
  of digital scholarly communications. Its inherent collaboration is built on three
  layers: a national collaborative commitment by the library community and the government
  enforced by community auditing and certification, a multi-stakeholder contractual
  participation in the preservation of targeted resources, and a cooperative network
  of qualified archiving nodes from and answering to the communities, together with
  reliable partnerships with international publishers. By designing collaboration
  into the operation of the service, it has achieved a powerful, robust, trusted,
  and sustainable digital preservation service for the Chinese library community
