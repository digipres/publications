abstract: 'With the development of digital technology, museums are facing a great
  challenge in the preservation and utilization of 3D data of cultural relics. Based
  on the demands on long-term preservation of 3D data of cultural relics by museums,
  a solution of 3D digitization of cultural relics is proposed in this paper for the
  unbalanced cost-efficiency-result, rare data utilization and inconsistent data storage
  scheme in the process of digitization. To solve the problem of unbalanced cost-efficiency-result,
  an evaluation model of 3D digitization has been designed by the Palace Museum, namely
  comprehensive “cost-efficiency-result” evaluation model. By adding a QR code control
  device for close range photogrammetry of cultural relics the high digitization cost,
  low digitization efficiency and inconsistent data quality are solved. Based on the
  specific needs of preservation and utilization, different grades are specified for
  3D data of cultural relics, and a three-layer hierarchical structure and storage
  scheme is designed in this paper, which solves data inconsistence and difficult
  data sharing. The above methods have been widely used in the digitization project
  of the Palace Museum, and the related studies and practices also provide reference
  for the further development of national 3D digitization standards.
