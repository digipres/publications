abstract: 'File format identification is a necessary step for the effective digital
  preservation of records. It allows appropriate actions to be taken for the curation
  and access of file types. The National Archives has existing processes

  for dealing with binary file format types, using tools such as PRONOM and DROID.
  These methods rely on using header information (metadata) and consistent binary

  sequences. However, these are not appropriate for the identification of text le
  formats as these do not contain recognisable header information or consistent patterns.
  Most text formats can be opened as plain text files, however

  file type information is often needed to understand the files use and context. Automated
  methods are necessary for text file format identification due to the scale of digital
  records processed by The National Archives, UK. An Artificial Intelligence methodology
  was tested and implemented using representative data collected from the GitHub repositories
  of UK Government departments. The

  first prototype developed has achieved reasonably good performance in successfully
  detecting five file formats with similar characteristics. The  results encourage
  us to carry out additional experiments to include further text file format types.
