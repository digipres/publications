abstract: 'Long-term readability of electronic data is a key regulatory requirement
  for archived data integrity in life sciences and pharmaceutical research. However,
  this has been difficult to achieve within current data and software preservation
  practice due to data dependence on specialty software which becomes unusable as
  a result of rapid obsolescence of hardware and operating systems.  This paper introduces
  a novel Executable Archive framework that extends traditional data archives with
  a platform for hosting legacy software and with processes for installing, use, and
  long-term maintenance of the software. Through a case study of a scientific software
  de-commissioning, we demonstrate the use of the framework for designing a solution
  for GLP-compliant software transition from operational to archival use and a secure
  processing of raw archived data to reconstruct past research studies. The framework
  is flexible and opens up opportunities for preservation planning and action that
  consider both data access and software management together, ensuring that the archived
  data integrity is fully supported by the long-term software integrity.
