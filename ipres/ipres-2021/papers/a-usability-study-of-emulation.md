abstract: In this paper, we study the usability of a range of emulators using video
  games as an example digital material. We investigate four different emulators using
  four different games from a period spanning 1963 to 2011. Four students who each
  played all of the four games assisted us in the study. From their responses we identified
  a number of usability challenges. Finally, we discuss possible solutions to the
  usability challenges founded.
