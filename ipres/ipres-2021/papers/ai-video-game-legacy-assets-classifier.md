abstract: "Our department collects vast chunks of assorted data from legacy servers
  left over after teams disband and/or studios close. In most cases the domain experts
  that created that data and knew how to use it moved on resulting in a loss of the
  knowledge needed to make sense of it. Our solution to this issue was to train an
  AI model that could help identify and classify this data and subsequently feed the
  output to our catalog application. \n\nOur demonstration would show how our model
  was trained, how it carries out predictions, and how well it performs on those predictions.
  To illustrate performance we will present confusion matrices, F1 scores, and precision-recall
  graphs. We will also outline future plans regarding model improvements and uses.\n"
