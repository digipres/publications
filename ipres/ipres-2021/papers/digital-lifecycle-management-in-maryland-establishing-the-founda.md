abstract: 'The Digital Lifecycle Management Interest Group (DLMIG) of the University
  System of Maryland and Associated Institutions (USMAI) formed in 2020 and provides
  a space for multi-institutional collaboration. The group is working toward a USMAI-wide
  digital lifecycle management strategy that will provide sustainable and scalable
  digital preservation and practices at consortium institutions of all sizes. This
  poster will share the groupâ€™s experiences and challenges thus far as a model for
  other consortia and collaborations.
