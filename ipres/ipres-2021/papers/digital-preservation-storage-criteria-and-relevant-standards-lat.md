abstract: 'This poster provides the latest updates on the Digital Preservation Storage
  Criteria. These Criteria are intended to help with developing requirements and evaluations
  of preservation storage solutions, to seed discussions about preservation storage,
  and/or to use as digital preservation instructional material. The Criteria are grouped
  into categories including content integrity, cost considerations, flexibility, information
  security, resilience, scalability & performance, support, and transparency. The
  working group created an accompanying usage guide covering risk management, independence,
  elements in establishing bit safety, and cost considerations as related to the Criteria,
  with new topics to be added in the next version. This year, the working group mapped
  each criterion to international standards that are relevant to Digital Preservation
  Storage such as ISO 16363 Audit and Certification of Trustworthy Digital Repositories
  and the ISO 27000 Information Security series. The aim of this poster is to discuss
  the mapping that was done between the criteria and these standards, as well as the
  proposed changes to the criteria and the associated usage guide as a result.
