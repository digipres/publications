abstract: 'Since 1996, the Internet Archive (IA) has provided storage, preservation,
  and access infrastructure and services to over 1,000 cultural heritage organizations
  around the world. It has also provided customized digital preservation services
  on a contractual basis to a handful of large institutions. In 2020, IA began building
  a more generalized digital preservation service in response to the needs of a broader
  range of institutions and to leverage IAâ€™s self-owned data centers, non-profit cloud
  services, and demonstrated expertise in both small and petabyte-scale digital stewardship.
  This system is being developed in direct dialogue with 30+ organizations, including
  universities, public libraries, arts organizations, and cultural heritage organizations,
  over the course of the 2021 - 2022 year. This paper shares key takeaways from the
  information collected from this pre-pilot phase and serves as a lean landscape review
  of the current gaps within the digital preservation landscape, particularly as they
  relate to the distinct needs and goals of nonprofits, libraries, and cultural heritage
  organizations, that this service aims to address.
