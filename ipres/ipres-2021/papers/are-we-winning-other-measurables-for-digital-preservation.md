abstract: 'This short paper reflects on the past 25 years of the Archaeology Data
  Service (ADS), a digital repository for UK heritage data.  The paper focusses on
  the benefits of the Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC) Rapid Assessment Model
  (RAM).  Experience of using the RAM has complimented the strengths of accreditation
  and has done much to focus on capacity and capability. It has also helped highlight
  successes that may otherwise be overlooked. For a smaller organization, these successes
  may not be intrinsically measurable in terms of bytes and processes, or the capacity
  to build a complex infrastructure, but simply demonstrating the reuse of the data
  so forensically preserved and the individuals that ensure that it matters.
