abstract: 'Thus far, software preservation in Dutch Heritage institutions is far from
  common practice. Over the course of 18 months the collaborative Software Archiving-project
  aimed to lower the threshold for institutions to start or advance software preservation.
  The project investigated the status quo, made recommendations and offered practical
  resources on emulation as a service, browser emulation and metadata for software
  preservation.
