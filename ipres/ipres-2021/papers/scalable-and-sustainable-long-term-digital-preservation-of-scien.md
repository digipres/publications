abstract: 'Abstract: The European Commission supported ARCHIVER project (Archiving
  and Preservation for Research Environments) aims to “introduce significant improvements
  in the area of archiving and digital preservation services, supporting the IT requirements
  of European scientists and providing end-to-end archival and preservation services,
  cost-effective for data generated in the petabyte range with high, sustained ingest
  rates, in the context of scientific research projects”.  This paper presents a software
  solution developed by Arkivum to meet the needs of long-term digital preservation
  of scientific datasets in ARCHIVER.  We present and discuss how this solution is
  scalable (able to process and store very large volumes of research data) and sustainable
  (both economically and environmentally). This is achieved through a combination
  of serverless computing, deployment on hyperscale infrastructure, and implementation
  of configurable ‘Minimum Effort Ingest’ workflows.  In particular, we show how high-performance
  and scalable Long Term Digital Preservation (LTDP) of very-large datasets can be
  done in a way that is entirely compatible with high levels of cost-efficiency and
  minimized environmental impact.
