abstract: 'An integrated research data management (RDM) enables reproducible and verifiable
  research, linking of interdisciplinary expertise, sharing of research for comparison,
  and integration of different analysis results and metadata studies. An increasing
  adoption of FAIR principles and requirements by funding agencies has significantly
  benefited overall quality, reuse, and sharing of research results. For scientists,
  a proper data management is a crucial element to prove their findings and make them
  reproducible. As a consequence, RDM had to become an integral part of the science
  support infrastructure in todays research institutions.


  Scientist of various disciplines should be supported over the data lifecycle starting
  from holistic planning of future projects to RDM related services provided: As RDM
  is a multidimensional endeavor requiring various skills; tasks ranging from community
  specific to community needs are optimally handed to the best qualified provider.
  The presented concepts and considerations are work in progress while establishing
  an organizational frameworks for a research university. Completely reproducible
  preferably open data publications including the relevant data-sets'' context are
  the ultimate goal. These require appropriate service components like EaaSI. The
  university strives to profit from the overlaps in RDM and digital preservation and
  to define the handover of tasks from the first to the latter.
