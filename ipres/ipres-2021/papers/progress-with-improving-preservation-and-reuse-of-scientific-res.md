abstract: 'We report progress towards automatically transforming existing analyses
  of scientific literature into annotations based on W3C''s Web Annotation Data Model
  (WADM). Case studies are presented from the life sciences, and social sciences and
  humanities, in which these developments have led to the creation of new unrestricted
  data services for the research community. We discuss the cross- domain potential
  of annotation infrastructure for releasing scientific facts reported in research
  literature from copyright restrictions, and demonstrate the utility of common standards-based
  preservation and discovery methods in disparate activities. We suggest that scientific
  treatments of literature using WADM annotation can lead to new mechanisms for access
  to and reuse of research data, and accelerate convergence with the FAIR Principles.
