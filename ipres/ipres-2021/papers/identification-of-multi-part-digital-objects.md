abstract: Digital information often relies on the interactions of multiple individual
  digital files, rather than being completely encapsulated in a single file. Where
  this happens, all necessary files should be considered to be part of the same Multi-Part
  digital object. This paper describes a data model for describing the format of such
  digital objects, or more specifically, the Multi-Part Representations of such objects.
  As with the identification of file formats, having a Representation Format like
  this enables us to determine which tools to use to undertake particular preservation
  actions for a Representation.
