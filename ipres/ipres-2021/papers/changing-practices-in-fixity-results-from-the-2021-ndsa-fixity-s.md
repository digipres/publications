abstract: 'Beyond the encouragement to check fixity, the field of digital preservation
  does not have a best practice on how to verify the stability of digital collections.
  Fixity verification is a contextual practice that is implemented differently at
  every organization. This poster presents the results of the 2021 NDSA Fixity Survey
  to better understand fixity practices at cultural heritage organizations.
