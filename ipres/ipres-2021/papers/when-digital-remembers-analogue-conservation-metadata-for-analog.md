abstract: 'While ""Digitization is not Digital Preservation"", the two processes are
  often closely connected. This is especially true for audiovisual (AV), where the
  analogue materials, much like their digital counterparts, come in a variety of formats
  and are only accessible via rendering equipment such as projectors. This indirect
  accessibility of analogue audiovisual makes autopsy a resource-intensive process.
  Nevertheless, it''s a necessary process prior to digitization, as the digital objects''
  quality depends on the quality of its analogue source material. But is analogue
  conservation data helpful in the preservation process of the digital object as well?
  Can it be used as Preservation Description Information in the OAIS sense?

  TIB, the German National Library of Science and Technology, has authored a Conservation
  Metadata Schema for Analogue Film as part of the large digitization and digital
  preservation project DELFT. The schema includes metadata which TIB considers important
  knowledge for the contextualization and interpretation of the digital AV object.
  This paper outlines motivation and background for this development, discusses the
  connection of analogue and digital in an overarching analogue conservation and digital
  preservation workflow and gives a detailed insight into the TIB Conservation Metadata
  Schema.
