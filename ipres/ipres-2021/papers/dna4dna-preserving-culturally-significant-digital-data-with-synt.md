abstract: 'The growing adoption of AI and data analytics in various sectors has resulted
  in digital preservation emerging as a cross-sectoral problem that affects everyone
  from data-driven enterprises to memory institutions alike. As all contemporary storage
  media suffer from fundamental density and durability limitations, researchers

  have started investigating new media that can offer high-density, long-term preservation
  of digital data. In the European Union-funded Future and Emerging Technologies project
  OligoArchive, we are exploring one such media, namely, synthetic Deoxyribo Nucleic
  Acid (DNA). In this paper, we provide an overview of the ongoing collaboration between
  project OligoArchive and the Danish National Archive in preserving culturally important
  digital data with synthetic DNA.
