abstract: 'Abstract – this paper briefly describes the establishment of a digital
  archival infrastructure to preserve one artwork from the late 90’s and a complete
  artist archive. Within those digital preservation processes an accessible, transparent
  and sustainable infrastructure will be designed, implemented and evaluated, fitting
  the existing collection management structure.  The most critical point is building
  a system relying on open source software in an institutional environment without
  dedicated knowledge and experience.  While building, testing and integrating the
  Linux working station to virtualize and transform those artworks it  is confirmed
  that this is an efficient method to built transparent institutional capacities and
  capabilities.
