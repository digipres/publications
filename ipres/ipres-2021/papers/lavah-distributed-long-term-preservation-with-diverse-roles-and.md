abstract: 'Distributed long-term preservation with diverse roles and responsibilities
  is the goal of the LaVaH project. The poster describes the division of work between
  stakeholders from the university libraries, the data centers, and the service provider
  for library infrastructure. Data management is done locally at the universities,
  central digital archiving tasks by the service provider (hebis) and storage infrastructure
  is hosted by two data centers.
