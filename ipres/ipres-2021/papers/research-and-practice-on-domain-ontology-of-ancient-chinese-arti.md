abstract: 'Collection information is one of the important resources that has long-term
  preservation value to museums. The paper proposes a domain ontology centered on
  ancient Chinese artifacts, aiming to help any organizations or individuals who own
  ancient Chinese artifacts collection better organize and manage their collection
  information, furthermore, improve collection search experience so that users can
  retrieve objects in the collection more easily and efficiently to ensure the availability
  of information as the digital object. The paper elaborates the creation process
  of “Ancient Chinese Artifacts Conceptual Reference Model” (ACACRM), summarizing
  and sharing practical experience for providing reference for museums with similar
  needs and application scenarios.
