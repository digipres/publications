abstract: 'Digital preservation (DP) service can be provided at various levels and
  by different agents. But the very nature of DP requires that the service be provided
  in a reliable, resilient, trustworthy, and sustainable way. This further demands
  a systematic thinking covering the contextual, legal, organizational, technical,
  administrative, financial, and personnel aspects of the services, and an evidence-based
  operations approach ensuring the requirements for trustworthiness is understandable,
  implementable, measurable, verifiable, retraceable, accountable, transparent, and
  efficiently executable. The auditing is a tool and an opportunity, but the resulting
  trustworthy service is the starting point and the desired result. The workshop will
  summarize international understanding, standards, and best practices, but will mainly
  use the experience of NDPP to illustrate how a real life digital preservation service
  develops itself in response to the requirements of trustworthiness auditing in regard
  of those principles. The audience will be asked to discuss their requirements and
  efforts or plans from their individual needs for digital preservation services.
