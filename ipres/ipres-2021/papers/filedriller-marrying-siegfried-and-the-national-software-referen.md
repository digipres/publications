abstract: 'Working with huge collections of unstructured data is a common yet still
  challenging task in digital preservation. This paper presents a tool for finding
  irrelevant files in large data sets to spot the relevant. The tool builds on two
  well-known and frequently used applications, respectively data sets and combines
  and extents them in a meaningful way.
