abstract: "I.\tINTRODUCTION \nThe PERSIST Content Task Force under the Preservation
  Subcommittee of the UNESCO Memory of the World Program would like to offer a workshop
  to participants at the iPres conference to be held in October 2021, titled: “Guidelines
  for the Selection of Digital Heritage for Long-Term Preservation: What, why, when.”
  The Workshop would be based on the 2nd edition of the UNESCO Guidelines for the
  Selection of Digital Heritage for Long-term Preservation. This edition will be officially
  launched during the 2nd Memory of the World Global Policy Forum to be held in Paris
  on 21-22 September 2021. \nThis one-hour workshop would be geared to an audience
  of practitioners of digital preservation.  The workshop would introduce the Guidelines,
  elaborate on key points made in the Guidelines, and provide opportunity to exchange
  questions and answers. The workshop would be informal, allowing for active interchange
  among the workshop participants and the workshop leader.\nII.\tOBJECTIVE\nThe workshop’s
  objective is to provide guidance and advice to participants about the appropriate
  digital resources that should be preserved by cultural and memory institutions for
  long-term access. \nIII.\tBACKGROUND AND RELEVANCE \nThe origin of these Guidelines
  was the very successful UNESCO Memory of the World conference held in 2012 in Vancouver
  Canada gathering over 600 global participants from cultural institutions, governments
  and the information industry to discuss digital information, its safekeeping, and
  continued access to these digital resources [link]. One of the conclusions of the
  conference was that there was a lack of information and guidance on what digital
  items should be kept for posterity, given the fact that the volume of digital information
  was almost incalculable. And since 2012, that number has multiplied many times over.
  Some selection of digital resources would be needed in order to keep the task manageable.\nTherefore,
  a Content Task Force, consisting of members from UNESCO, The International Council
  on Archives (ICA) and led by IFLA was created to develop guidelines to assist practitioners
  and decision makers in making informed decisions about what digital resources should/must
  be kept for long term access.\nThe result was the publication “Guidelines for the
  selection of digital heritage for long-term access” which was launched in 2016 and
  widely used for training and advocacy purposes around the world.\nFive years is
  a long time in the digital ecosystem, and it was felt necessary to bring the Guidelines
  up to date, especially to add some of the newer forms of digital resources widely
  available. ICA, The International Council of Museums (ICOM) and IFLA representatives
  as well as other experts worked for the past 18 months, in a virtual way, to develop
  the second edition of the Guidelines. This publication will be officially launched
  in September 2021.\nTherefore, the timing is perfect to bring this publication to
  the attention of practitioners and decision makers dealing with the challenges of
  preserving digital information at this iPres conference. This workshop would fit
  under Sub-theme 4: Building the Capacity.\n"
