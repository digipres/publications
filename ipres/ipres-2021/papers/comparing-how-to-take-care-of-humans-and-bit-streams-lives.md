abstract: "This paper investigates a number of practices to ensure safety for human
  lives and compare them with practices to ensure the ‘lives’ of bit-streams. The
  selected practices for human lives are: A. common emergency preparedness practices
  for securement of places like shopping centers, B. safety critical systems commonly
  used for airplanes, space crafts and nuclear power plants, and C. pandemic preparation
  planning. \nThe results of the comparison are used to illustrate how human security
  precautions can be used in similar ways in a bit preservation case involving methods
  and systems on both the technical and the organizational level"
