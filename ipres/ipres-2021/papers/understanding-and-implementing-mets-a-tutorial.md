abstract: This half day tutorial will provide participants with an introduction to
  the Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS) and the METS Primer. It will
  give a basic overview of the standard and explore different models of implementation.
  The METS schema is a standard for encoding descriptive, administrative, and structural
  metadata regarding objects within a digital library as well as digital archives,
  expressed using the XML schema language of the World Wide Web Consortium. It is
  maintained by the METS Board and the METS Maintenance Activity is managed by the
  Library of Congress
