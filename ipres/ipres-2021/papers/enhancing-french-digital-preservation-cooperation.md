abstract: "Since 2019, four groups have been created within the French association
  “Aristote”, including members of National Library & Archives and several Ministries.
  \n\nThese four groups are working on these subjects: \n\n1. Digital Formats knowledge:
  in all our institutions we must deal with many different formats, it was necessary
  to share our experience, help each other, and propose tools to help the French digital
  preservation community to think about the development of format preservation strategies.\n\n2.
  Translation: because most of the documentation about digital preservation is not
  available in French.\n\n3. Expertise: it's necessary to identify and share our experts’
  knowledge on file formats between institutions because of the lack of human resources
  in the digital preservation domain.\n\n4. Tools: many tools are available, and we
  can offer a national guidance through our experimentations.\n\nIn conclusion, the
  creation of these groups has set up new ways to improve our National digital preservation
  strategy.\n\nThe poster is made with BDNF (https://bdnf.bnf.fr/), a free application
  from the French national Library, it was created to use digital objects and images
  available in Gallica, the French digital national library online (https://gallica.bnf.fr).\n"
