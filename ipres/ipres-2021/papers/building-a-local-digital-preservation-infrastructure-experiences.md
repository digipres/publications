abstract: 'As cultural heritage organizations seek solutions, open source, community-based,
  and commercial digital preservation systems and tools have proliferated. Nevertheless,
  given the magnitude of digital content and the requirements of specific file formats,
  institutions struggle to integrate disparate tools and systems to support their
  institutional preservation programs. The purpose of the panel discussion is to provide
  insights from on-the-ground implementations of current preservation tools and to
  consider the opportunities and challenges in deploying and integrating these tools
  with local digital content management processes.
