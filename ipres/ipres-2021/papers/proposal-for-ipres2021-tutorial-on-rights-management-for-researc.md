abstract: 'Purpose: Research data (RD) is a fast developing area of digital resources
  that requires long-term preservation. But the acquisition, processing, share, and
  preservation of RD involve complicated rights issues among multi-stakeholders with
  different or conflicting interests. Only with well-designed, easy-to-implement,
  and balanced rights management, we can achieve an effective, reliable, robust, sustainable
  research data management and preservation. This tutorial aims to summarize issues
  and best practices in this regard to stimulate further discussion on it.
