abstract: 'UNESCO Memory of the World Programme (MoW) and its Preservation Sub-Committee
  are concerned with the long term and sustained access to the World’s documentary
  heritage, including digital. They are keen to engage with the digital preservation
  professionals around the world, to gather the requirements for effective international
  policies to support digital preservation actions and, more importantly, work towards
  reliable access to the world’s documentary heritage, now and in the far future.
  The past two decades have seen unprecedented increase in publishing, documenting,
  and communicating in the digital form, giving rise to a wealth of knowledge, insights
  and experiences. Digital information is becoming critical for education, skill building
  and participation in the global digital economy. This panel is organized by the
  UNESCO Preservation Sub-Committee to discuss the critical technological, policy
  and sustainability factors in providing effective access to the World’s digital
  documentary heritage.
