abstract: 'Preservation pipelines demonstrate extended value when digitized content
  is also computation-ready. Expanding this to historical controlled vocabularies
  requires additional steps if they are to be fully leveraged for research. This paper
  reports on work addressing this challenge. We report on a pipeline and project progress
  addressing three key goals: 1) transforming the 1910 Library of Congress Subject
  Headings (LCSH) to the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) linked data standard,
  2) implementing persistent identifiers (PIDs) and launching our prototype ARK resolver,
  and 3) importing the 1910 LCSH into the Helping Interdisciplinary Vocabulary Engineering
  (HIVE) System to support automatic metadata generation and scholarly analysis of
  the historical record. The discussion considers the implications of our work in
  the broader context of preservation, and the conclusion summarizes our work and
  identifies next steps.
