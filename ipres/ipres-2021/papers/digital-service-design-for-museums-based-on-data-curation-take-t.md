abstract: 'Abstract â€“ with a collection of more than a million works and an early
  start in informatization, the Palace Museum manages a large number of cultural artifacts
  and digital assets. At present, the Palace Museum is committed to improving the
  active management of its digital content. In particular, the Museum aims to strengthen
  the long-term preservation of digital content to meet the preservation and utilization
  challenges brought about by the phenomenal growth of its digital content. This paper
  analyzes the top-level design, implementation, and evaluation of the Palace Museum''s
  one-stop online digital platform through the concept of data curation and the DCC
  curation lifecycle model. The analysis discusses the positive role that digital
  curation plays in practice for digital content production, preservation, and service
  and provides a reference point for other museums.
