abstract: 'Databases preserved in archives contain highly valuable information that
  frequently cannot be made freely accessible for analyses via standard data portals,
  be it due to legal, commercial or ethical issues. We present OSSDIP, the reference
  implementation of a high-security data visiting infrastructure initially conceived
  as a safe-compute environment for medical data. It provides highly controlled and
  monitored data visiting services while ensuring to the largest degree possible that
  data cannot be extracted from the infrastructure. This may offer archives a viable
  alternative for providing restricted access to sensitive data in a more flexible
  manner.
