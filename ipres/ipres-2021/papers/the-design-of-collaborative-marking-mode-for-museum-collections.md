abstract: 'Collaborative tagging is a way of information collection after the popularity
  of the Internet. Digital resource preservation and management organizations are
  very interested in this way, and have done a lot of research. However, this method
  is affected by the uneven level of information providers, the difficulty in confirming
  the accuracy of information, and the risk of unverified information exposure on
  the platform. In this paper, we will design a collaborative tagging model, which
  uses the content of user''s spontaneous tagging as the basis, through the three
  stages of self-use tag, collective tag audit and public tag, to supplement the collection
  information and improve the efficiency of digital resource retrieval.
