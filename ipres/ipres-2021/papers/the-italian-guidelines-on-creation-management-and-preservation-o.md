abstract: 'This paper aims to address the issue of file formats assessment for the
  preservation of digital records, which is fundamental because the chances of preserving
  records produced in these formats over time depend greatly on it. In particular,
  the paper presents and discusses the methodology proposed by the Italian Agency
  for Digital Government who recently published the “Guidelines on the Creation, Management
  and Preservation of Digital Records”. This methodology is based on a quantitative
  method that evaluates some properties of file formats and assigns them a score;
  the sum of these scores is the so-called “interoperability index” that provides
  useful information in order to establish whether the format is prone to obsolescence
  or not. The methodology is explained with examples that show its potential. Some
  suggestions for improvement and further developments are then discussed.
