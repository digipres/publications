abstract: 'Scholars rely upon ongoing access to the published research in their fields.
  For journals to disappear is to harm the ability of scholars to conduct their work.
  Recent research has indicated that journals published by the long tail of smaller
  publishers may be especially at risk for disappearing from the Web. Five leading
  organizations are collaborating to significantly improve the number of Open Access
  journals that are being preserved for the long-term, in a project named “Journals
  Preserved Forever” (nicknamed “JASPER”).
