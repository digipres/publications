abstract: 'Community Owned digital Preservation Tool Registry (COPTR) was developed
  in 2013 to provide efficient “one stop shopping” for practitioners performing research
  on digital preservation tools and services. It contains information on over 500
  tools and since 2021 has been equipped with semantic MediaWiki capabilities. This
  makes a large part of the information within the registry machine-readable and possible
  to query by API. It opens new possibilities for creating tool overviews and allowing
  users to find comparisons that will be useful to them. It also makes new integrations
  possible for projects, which are based on data harvested from COPTR.


  COPTR Edit-A-Thon during iPRES2021 invites the international digital preservation
  community to come together in a common effort to enrich the data in COPTR, explore
  the possibilities of the recently added semantic annotation, and discuss the future
  of the registry. It will combine hands-on editing, group discussions, and brainstorms
  conducted in a hybrid manner. With this edit-a-thon we aim to develop new/improved
  entries, new ideas for making the most of the new functionality, and new items to
  add to the “to do” list for future improvements. This event is for everyone interested
  in tools and workflows for digital preservation and does not require any specialized
  knowledge.
