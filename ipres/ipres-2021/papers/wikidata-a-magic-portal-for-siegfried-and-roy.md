abstract: 'A project team was established in late 2019 to create a Siegfried/Wikidata
  integration. The project was established to make Yale University Libraryâ€™s work
  curating digital preservation data in Wikidata actionable; that is, enable it to
  be consumed by the Siegfried utility for the purpose of file format identification.
  Once accessible by such a tool, file-system data can be linked directly to Wikidata
  records and thus the breadth and depth of the Wikidata dataset. The combination
  opens up possibilities around the EaaSI work also being developed with Wikidata
  in mind. The Siegfried/Wikidata collaboration was an intentional one that would
  have been difficult to make happen through normal circumstances; be that geographic
  or organisational dispersal, opportunity, or cost. The project was seen as a worthwhile
  endeavour to pursue independently of these restrictions and other projects may in
  the future need to resort to non-traditional approaches to achieve their aim. The
  first iteration of this work successfully went live in October 2020 and for it to
  continue to succeed there is a call to arms from those in the digital preservation
  and Wikidata communities to help push it further. Work in the pipeline is believed
  will continue to demonstrate the worthwhile nature of today''s commitment.
