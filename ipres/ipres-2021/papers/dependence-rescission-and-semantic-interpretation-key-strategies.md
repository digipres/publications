abstract: 'There are three states of archival objects and their corresponding management
  measures. Clarifying the continuity or discreteness of signals and semantics of
  three states is very important in preservation. For objects at digital state, low-order
  logic dependencies with software and hardware dependencies as the core need to be
  removed. And for objects at data state, high-order logic dependencies with semantic
  associations as the core need to be removed.
