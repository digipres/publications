abstract: 'The source code of landmark software developed since the beginning of the

  computer era is a precious part of our cultural heritage, and needs to be

  properly rescued, curated, archived and made available to present and future

  generations. In this article, we present the Software Heritage Acquisition

  Process, that has been designed to provide detailed guidelines on how to

  perform this important task, preserving important historical information.


  This process has been validated extensively on several important pieces

  of software source code of historical relevance in the University of Pisa,

  in collaboration with UNESCO, and is open to all for adoption and improvement.
