abstract: 'In order to assess the potential suitability of digital preservation efforts
  for future research, it is necessary to understand how users interact with information
  in the present. Yet there is very little information on how humanities researchers
  – a key user group for archives – interact with archives beyond discovery. In the
  following, we show the importance of recognising end-users as part of wider information
  workflows that comprise not only discovery but the reuse of information and an unfolding
  interpretation of materials to construct new knowledge. We make our case through
  the presentation of findings from a naturalistic empirical observation of 11 humanities
  researchers engaging in research at a national archive. Our work identifies two
  research practices important to knowledge construction – reading and collecting
  –through which scholars create an interpretation of the archival record situated
  in its wider context.
