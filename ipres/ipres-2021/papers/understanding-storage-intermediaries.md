abstract: 'Storage intermediaries are software, and sometimes hardware appliances
  that act as a link between applications and storage media, performing a range of
  tasks, such as protocol translation, caching, compression or even encryption. This
  paper describes storage intermediaries and their key functions that librarians and
  archivists should be aware of, as these introduce technical dependencies that can
  impact digital preservation.
