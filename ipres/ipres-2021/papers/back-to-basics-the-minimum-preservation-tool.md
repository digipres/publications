abstract: 'This paper presents the Minimum Preservation Tool (MPT), designed and developed
  by the British Library to provide a basic technical digital preservation service
  for collections awaiting ingest to a more formal digital preservation repository.
  The MPT can satisfy fundamental preservation storage requirements that are not typically
  otherwise supported in a standard corporate technical environment more focused on
  cyber-security. Replication, checksum generation and validation, and regular reporting
  are all key features of the MPT, written as a set of Python Utilities and freely
  available on Github. MPT is an entry-level tool that lowers the bar for early participation
  in preservation endeavors, in contrast with larger scale and more expensive, complex
  end-to-end technical solutions.
