abstract: 'In 2019 the Library of Congress launched the Digital Collections Management
  Compendium (DCMC). This publicly available resource establishes and communicates
  institutional digital collections management policy. A core function of the DCMC
  is to articulate the connections between broader digital collections management
  policy and that of planning resources produced and/or consulted by Library staff.
  This paper provides information regarding the development of the DCMC and its key
  features, and supports use of the DCMC as a public resource. We intend this paper
  to be of use to others working on organization-wide digital collections management
  initiatives. More broadly, the paper contributes to the discussion on how work around
  digital collections policy and planning connects with practice.
