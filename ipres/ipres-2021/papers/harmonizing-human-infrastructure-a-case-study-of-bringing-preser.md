abstract: 'The Hesburgh Libraries and Snite Museum of Art at the University of Notre
  Dame were awarded a 3-year grant that provided funding for a unified, cross-institutional
  discovery and exhibition platform that promotes serendipitous discovery of digitized
  cultural heritage materials. Although many digital preservation concerns were outside
  the scope of the grant, one beneficial output of the project has been renewed discussion
  and interest around robust digital preservation implementations appropriate for
  each institutionsâ€™ specific needs. From derivative access copies to preservation
  TIFF images, the lightweight technical solution was designed to meet the discovery
  needs of the grant partners and also leave room to connect the project with future
  digital preservation systems and infrastructure. In this paper, we will discuss
  how our efforts to bring together different types of cultural heritage materials
  was also informed by an opportunity to consider digital preservation needs. We will
  describe the flexible, human-centered workflows that the team developed to prioritize
  education and collaboration, while leaving space for future preservation initiatives.
  This case study will provide concrete examples of how to bring workflows from disparate
  library, archive, and museum (LAM) units into harmony while being sensitive to both
  current, local practices as well as perceived future needs.
