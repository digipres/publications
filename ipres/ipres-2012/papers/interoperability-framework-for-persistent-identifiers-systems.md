abstract: 'In this paper, we propose an Interoperability Framework (IF) for Persistent
  Identifiers (PI) systems that addresses functions, roles and responsibilities needed
  to make heterogeneous PI systems interoperable. The fundamental steps, which provided
  the main inputs for the design of the model have been: 1) a survey on the use of
  PI among different stakeholder communities and 2) the definition of interoperability
  use cases and requirements. The IF is presented as a solution addressing the PI
  interoperability issues, which have been identified in the survey and have been
  translated into concrete use cases to serve as requirements for designing the model.
  Conclusions and intended future work close the paper.'
