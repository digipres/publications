abstract: The biblioblogosphere comprises the personal, typically professional-oriented
  publication of blogs by information and library science practitioners, researchers,
  and educators. This poster presents preliminary findings from a descriptive study
  examining bibliobloggers’ attitudes and preferences for digital preservation, and
  their respective blog publishing behaviors and blog characteristics influencing
  preservation action. Findings will be compared to those from an earlier study of
  blogging scholars from the fields of history, economics, law, biology, chemistry
  and physics. When considering their dual role as publishers contributing to the
  scholarly record and, in reflection of their professional roles, work relating to
  stewardship of this record, bibliobloggers present an exceptional case to extend
  and better understand the phenomenon of blogging in academe and implications for
  long-term stewardship of this form.
