abstract: 'We describe algorithms for automated quality assurance on content of audio
  files in context of preservation actions and access. The algorithms use cross correlation
  to compare the sound waves. They are used to do overlap analysis in an access scenario,
  where preserved radio broadcasts are used in research and annotated. They have been
  applied in a mi- gration scenario, where radio broadcasts are to be migrated for
  long term preservation. This work was partially supported by the SCAPE Project.

  The SCAPE project is co-funded by the European Union under FP7 ICT-2009.4.1 (Grant
  Agreement number 270137).'
