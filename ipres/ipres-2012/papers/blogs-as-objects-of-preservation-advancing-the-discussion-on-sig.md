abstract: The quest for identifying ‘significant properties’ is a common challenge
  for the digital preservation community. While the methodological frameworks for
  selecting these properties provide a good foundation, a continued discussion is
  necessary for further clarifying and improving the available methods. This paper
  advances earlier work by building on the existing InSPECT framework and improving
  its capabilities of working with complex/compound objects like blogs. The modifications
  enable a more thorough analysis of object structures, accentuate the differences
  and similarities between the framework’s two streams of analysis (i.e. Object and
  Stakeholder analysis) and, subsequently, improve the final reformulation of the
  properties. To demonstrate the applicability of the modified framework, the paper
  presents a use case of a blog preservation initiative that is informed by stakeholder
  interviews and evaluation of structural and technological foundations of blogs.
  It concludes by discussing the limitations of the approach and suggesting directions
  for future research.
