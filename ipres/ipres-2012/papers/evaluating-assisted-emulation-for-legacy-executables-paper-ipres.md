abstract: 'Access to many born-digital materials can only be accomplished economically
  through the use of emulation where contemporaneous software is executed on an emulated
  ma- chine. For example, many thousands of CD-ROMs have been published containing
  proprietary software that cannot be reasonably recreated. While emulation is proven
  technology and is widely used to run both current and obsolete versions of Windows
  and Unix operating systems, it suffers a fatal flaw as a preservation strategy by
  requiring future users to be facile with today’s operating systems and software.

  We have previously advocated “assisted emulation” as a strategy to alleviate this
  shortcoming. With assisted emulation, a preserved object is stored along with scripts
  designed to control a legacy software environment and access to the object enabled
  through a “helper” application. In this pa- per we significantly extend this work
  by examining, for a large data set, both the cost of creating such scripts and the
  common problems that these scripts must resolve.'
