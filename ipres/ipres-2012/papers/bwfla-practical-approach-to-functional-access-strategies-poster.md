abstract: The goal of the bwFLA project is the implementation and development of services
  and technologies to address Baden-Wurttemberg state and higher education institutes’
  libraries’ and archives’ challenges in long-term digital object access. The project
  aims on enabling diverse user groups to pre- pare non-standard artifacts like digital
  art, scientific applications or GIS data for preservation. The project’s main goal
  is to build-on ongoing digital preservation research in international and national
  projects to integrate workflows for emulation-based access strategies.
