abstract: 'Evaluating digital preservation actions performed on digital objects is
  essential, both during the planning as well as quality assurance and re-use phases
  to determine their authenticity. While migration results are usually validated by
  comparing object properties from before and after the migration, the task is more
  complex: as any digital object becomes an information object only in a rendering
  environment, the evaluation has to happen at a rendering level for validating its
  faithfulness. This is basically identical to the situation of evaluating the performance
  in an emulation setting.

  In this paper we show how previous conceptual work is applied to an existing emulator,
  allowing us to feed automated input to the emulation environment as well as extract
  properties about the rendering process. We identify various significant key characteristics
  that help us evaluate deviations in the emulatorâ€™s internal timing compared to the
  original system and how we can find out if the emulation environment works deterministically,
  an important characteristic that is necessary for successful comparison of renderings.
  We show the results of rendering different digital objects in the emulator and interpret
  them for the rendering process, showing weaknesses in the evaluated emulator and
  provide possible corrections as well as generalized recommendations for developing
  emulators for digital preservation.'
