abstract: 'Digital preservation is increasingly recognized as a need by organizations
  from diverse areas that have to manage information over time and make use of information
  systems for supporting the business. Methods for assessment of digital preservation
  compliance inside an organization have been introduced, such as the Trustworthy
  Repositories Audit & Certification: Criteria and Checklist. However, these methods
  are oriented towards repository-based scenarios and are not geared at assessing
  the real digital preservation capabilities of organizations whose information management
  processes are not compatible with the usage of a repository-based solution. In this
  paper we propose a checklist assessment method for digital preservation derived
  from a capability-based reference architecture for digital preservation. Based on
  the detailed description of digital preservation capabilities provided in the reference
  architecture, it becomes possible to assess concrete scenarios for the existence
  of capabilities using a checklist. We discuss the application of the method in two
  institutional scenarios dealing with the preservation of e-Science data, where clear
  gaps where identified concerning the logical preservation of data. The checklist
  assessment method proved to be a valuable tool for raising awareness of the digital
  preservation issues in those organizations.'
