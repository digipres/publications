abstract: Digital curation may be thought of as a set of strategies, technological
  approaches, and activities for establishing and developing trusted repositories,
  and ensuring long-term access to digital assets. It spans many disciplines and communities,
  as well as individuals seeking to maintain, preserve and add value to the ever-expanding
  body of digital content. This diversity has given way to ambiguity in defining digital
  curation, particularly in consideration of potentially synonymous terms, such as
  digital stewardship, preservation, and archiving. This poster will provide a forum
  for participants to challenge and engage in the dialogue that defines and describes
  digital curation.
