abstract: 'In this paper, we describe the current challenges to the effective management
  and preservation of research data in UK universities, and the response provided
  by the JISC Managing Research Data programme.

  This paper will discuss, inter alia, the findings and conclusions from data management
  training projects of the first iteration of the programme and how they informed
  the design of the second, paying particular attention to initiatives to develop
  and embed training materials.'
