abstract: In the beginning, SPAR, the National Library of France's repository, was
  designed as the OAIS softwarified. It was intended to be a "full OAIS", covering
  all preservation needs in one tidy system. Then as its potential revealed itself
  across the library, high hopes arose for a do-it-all digital curation tool. Yet
  in day to day preservation activities of the BnF, it turns out that SPAR's growth
  takes a practical approach to the essentials of preservation and the specific needs
  of communities. Renewed dialogue with producers and users has led to the addition
  of functions the digital preservation team would not have thought of. This is very
  clear in what has been created to ingest the BnF's web archives into SPAR, giving
  the community more information on their data, and in what is taking shape to deal
  with the BnF's administrative archives, adding new functionalities to the system.The
  difference between what preservations tools and what curation tools should be at
  the BnF will have to be examined over time, to ensure all the communities' needs
  are met while SPAR remains viable.
