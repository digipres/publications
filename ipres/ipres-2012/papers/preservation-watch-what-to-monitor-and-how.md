abstract: 'For successful preservation operations, a preservation system needs to
  be capable of monitoring compliance of preservation operations to specifications,
  alignment of these operations with the organisationâ€™s preservation objectives, and
  associated risks and opportunities. This requires linking a number of diverse information
  sources and specifying complex conditions. For example, the content to be preserved
  needs to be related to specifications of significant properties, to the file formats
  used to represent that content, to the software environments available to analyse,
  render and convert it and the technical environments available to the designated
  user communities that will consume this content.

  This article analyses aspects of interest in a preservation context that call for
  automated monitoring and investigates the feasibility of drawing sufficient information
  from diverse sources together and linking it in a meaningful way. We define a number
  of preservation triggers that lead to preservation planning activities and present
  the requirements and a high-level design of a preservation watch system that is
  currently being developed. We demonstrate the value of such a monitoring approach
  on a number of scenarios and cases.'
