abstract: Managing authenticity is a crucial issue in the preservation of digital
  medical records, because of their legal value and of their relevance to the Scientific
  Community as experimental data. In order to assess the authenticity and the provenance
  of the records, one must be able to trace back, along the whole extent of their
  lifecycle since their creation, all the relevant events and transformations they
  have undergone and that may have affected their authenticity and provenance and
  collect the Preservation Description Information (PDI) as categorized by OAIS. This
  paper presents a model and a set of operational guidelines to collect and manage
  the authenticity evidence to properly document these transformations, that have
  been developed within the APARSEN project, a EU funded NoE, as an implementation
  of the InterPARES conceptual framework and of the CASPAR methodology. Moreover we
  discuss the implementation of the guidelines in a medical environment, the health
  care preservation repository in Vicenza Italy, where digital resources have a quite
  complex lifecycle including several changes of custody, aggregations and format
  migrations. The case study has proved the robustness of the methodology, which stands
  as a concrete proposal for a systematic and operational way to deal with the problem
  of authenticity management in complex environments.  Work partially supported by
  the European Community under the Information Society Technologies (IST) program
  of the 7th FP for RTD - project APARSEN, ref. 269977.
