abstract: A quite general view of the digital preservation problem and its associated
  tasks (e.g. intelligibility and task-performability checking, risk detection, identification
  of missing resources for performing a task) is to approach it from a dependency
  management point of view. In this paper we extend past rule-based approaches for
  dependency management for modeling also converters and emulators and we demonstrate
  how this modeling allows performing the desired reasoning and thus enables offering
  more advanced digital preservation services. Specifically these services can greatly
  reduce the human effort required for periodically checking (monitoring) whether
  a task on a digital object is performable.
