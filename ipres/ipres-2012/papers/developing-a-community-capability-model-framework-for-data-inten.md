abstract: 'Researchers across a range of fields have been inspired by the

  possibilities of data-intensive research. In many cases, however,

  researchers find themselves unable to take part due to a lack of

  facilities, insufficient access to data, cultural disincentives, and a

  range of other impediments. In order to develop a deeper

  understanding of this, UKOLN, University of Bath and Microsoft

  Research have been collaborating on developing a Community

  Capability Model Framework (CCMF) designed to assist

  institutions, research funding-bodies and researchers to enhance

  the capability of their communities to perform data-intensive

  research. This paper explores the rationale for using capability

  modelling for informing the development of data-intensive

  research and outlines the main capability factors underlying the

  current version of the CCMF.'
