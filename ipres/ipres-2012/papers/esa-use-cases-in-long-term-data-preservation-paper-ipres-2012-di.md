abstract: Long Term Data Preservation (LTDP) aims at ensuring the intelligibility
  of digital information at any given time in the near or distant future. LTDP has
  to address changes that inevitably occur in hardware or software, in the organisational
  or legal environment, as well as in the designated community, i.e. the people that
  will use the preserved information. A preservation data manages communication from
  the past while communicating with the future. Information generated in the past
  is sent into the future by the current preservation data. European Space Agency
  (ESA) has a crucial and unique role in this mission, because it maintains in its
  archives long time series of Earth Observation (EO) data. In order to ensure to
  future generations data use and accessibility of this cultural heritage is needed
  to define a systematic approach, accompanied by different use cases.
