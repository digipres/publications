abstract: Digital preservation workflows for image collections involving automatic
  and semi-automatic image acquisition and processing are prone to reduced quality.
  We present a method for quality assurance of scanned content based on computer vision.
  A visual dictionary derived from local image descriptors enables efficient perceptual
  image fingerprinting in order to compare scanned book pages and detect duplicated
  pages. A spatial verification step involving descriptor matching provides further
  robustness of the approach. Results for a digitized book collection of approximately
  35.000 pages are presented. Duplicated pages are identified with high reliability
  and well in accordance with results obtained independently by human visual inspection.
