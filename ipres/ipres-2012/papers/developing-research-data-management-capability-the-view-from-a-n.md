abstract: 'An increasing number of UK Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are developing
  Research Data Management (RDM) support services. Their action reflects a changing
  technical, social and political environment, guided by principles set out in the
  Research Councils UK (RCUK) Common Principles on Data Policy. These reiterate expectations
  that publicly-funded research should be openly accessible, requiring that research
  data are effectively managed. The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council
  (EPSRC) policy framework is particularly significant, as it sets a timeframe for
  institutions to develop and implement a roadmap for research data management.

  The UK Digital Curation Centre (DCC) is responding to such changes by supporting
  universities to develop their capacity and capability for research data management.
  This paper describes an ‘institutional engagement’ programme, identifying our approach,
  and providing examples of work undertaken with UK universities to develop and implement
  RDM services. We are working with twenty-one HEIs over an eighteen month period,
  across a range of institution types, with a balance in research strengths and geographic
  spread. The support provided varies based on needs, but may include advocacy and
  awareness raising, defining user requirements, policy development, piloting tools
  and training. Through this programme we will develop a service model for institutional
  support and a transferable RDM toolkit.'
