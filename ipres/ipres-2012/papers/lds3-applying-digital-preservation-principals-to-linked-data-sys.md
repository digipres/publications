abstract: Data publishing using semantic web and linked data techniques enables the
  sharing of detailed information. Importantly this information is shared using common
  standards and vocabularies to enable simple re-use. In the digital preservation
  community, an increasing number of systems are adopting linked data techniques for
  sharing data, including the PRONOM and UDFR technical registries. In many systems,
  only current information is being shared. Further, this information is not being
  described with data relating to who and when it was published. Such basic metadata
  is seen as essential in all digital preservation systems, how- ever has been overlooked
  to a large extent when publishing linked data. This failing is partly due to there
  being very few specifications, reference implementations and verification systems
  in place to aid with publishing this type of linked data. This publication introduces
  the Linked Data Simple Storage Specification, a solution that enables careful curation
  linked data by following a series of current best practise guidelines. Through construction
  of a reference implementation, this work introduces how historical information can
  be referenced and discovered in order to build customisable alerting services for
  risk management in preservation systems.
