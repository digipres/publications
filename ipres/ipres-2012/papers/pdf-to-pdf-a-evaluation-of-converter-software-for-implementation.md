abstract: PDF/A is a version of Portable Document Format backed by ISO standard that
  is designed for archiving and preservation of electronic documents. Many electronic
  documents exist in PDF format. Due to its popularity, the ability to convert an
  existing PDF into a conforming PDF/A file is as important, if not more, as being
  able to produce documents in PDF/A format in digital preservation. In recognition
  of this fact and encouraged by growing interest from its affiliates, the Florida
  Digital Archive (FDA) conducted an evaluation of several of the PDF to PDF/A converter
  applications, the result of which is reported in this paper. There is room for interpretation
  in the ISO standards concerning PDF/A, which can be manifest in the development
  of software. In selecting a PDF to PDF/A converter product, reliability of the outcome
  in terms of PDF/A compliance must be established along with functionality. The goal
  of this paper is not to rank or promote the software evaluated, but rather to document
  the FDAâ€™s evaluation process and present the results in such a way that they provide
  insight into challenges and potential drawbacks during similar evaluation or implementation.
