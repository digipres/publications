abstract: In this paper I am discussing the repositioning of traditional conservation
  concepts of historicity, authenticity and versioning in relation to born digital
  artworks, upon findings from my research on preservation of computer-based artifacts.
  Challenges for digital art preservation and previous work in this area are described,
  followed by an analysis of digital art as a process of components interaction, as
  performance and in terms of instantiations. The concept of dynamic authenticity
  is proposed, and it is argued that our approach to digital artworks preservation
  should be variable and digital object responsive, with a level of variability tolerance
  to match digital art intrinsic variability and dynamic authenticity.
