abstract: This paper provides a practical example of digital archeology and forensics
  to recover data from floppy disks originally used by CTOS, now an obsolete computer
  operating system. The various floppy disks were created during the period between
  the mid 1980s to the mid 1990s containing different types of text, data and binary
  files. This paper presents practical steps from two different approaches, the tools
  and workflows involved which can help archivists and digital preservation practitioners
  recover data from outdated systems and media. While the floppy disk data recovery
  was a full success, issues remain in filetype detection and interpretation of non-ASCII
  data files of unknown or unsupported types.
