abstract: In this paper, we describe research led by Educopia Institute regarding
  the preservation needs for digitized and born-digital newspapers. The Chronicles
  in Preservation project, builds upon previous efforts (e.g. the U.S. National Digital
  Newspaper Program) to look more broadly at the needs of digital newspapers in all
  of their diverse and challenging forms. This paper conveys the findings of the first
  research phase, including substantive survey results regarding digital newspaper
  curation practices.
