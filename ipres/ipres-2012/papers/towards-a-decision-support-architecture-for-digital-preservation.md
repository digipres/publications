abstract: 'In this paper, we present and address a number of challenges in digital
  preservation of entire business processes: (1) identifying digital objects a business
  process depends on (“What to preserve and why?”); (2) identifying significant changes
  in digital objects (“When to preserve and why?”); (3) determining a re-deployment
  setting (“What to re-deploy and why?”). After highlighting these challenges, we
  illustrate some aspects of business processes that are relevant in the context of
  digital preservation and provide a model to capture their semantics formally. We,
  then, proceed to present a decision support architecture to address the challenges
  using the developed model. We, finally, conclude the paper by discussing the applicability
  of our proposed model and its associated techniques.'
