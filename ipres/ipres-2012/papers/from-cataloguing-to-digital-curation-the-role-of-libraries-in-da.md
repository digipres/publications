abstract: 'This paper describes the work of the Opportunities for Data Exchange (ODE)
  project, a project funded by the European Commission under Framework Programme 7.
  This project investigates issues surrounding data preservation, reuse and exchange
  from both sociological and technical view points.

  Led by the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN), the project has sought
  out stories of success and honorable failures. It has also brought together representatives
  of key stakeholder in the data preservation and sharing landscape. This has enabled
  dialogue between these stakeholder in order to identify opportunities for researchers,
  publishers and libraries to play their part in data exchange.

  The growing need for research data preservation and curation services, the linking
  of data to publications, and increasing awareness of the potential of data sharing
  for innovation, presents a major opportunity for libraries to redefine their roles
  and embed themselves in the research process. In November 2011 ODE surveyed the
  420 plus LIBER member libraries to establish what demand from researchers libraries
  are experiencing for support in data exchange, what roles they need to fulfill,
  and what new skills they need to develop and how. The results clearly emphasised
  the importance of the development of the role of the library in digital curation.'
