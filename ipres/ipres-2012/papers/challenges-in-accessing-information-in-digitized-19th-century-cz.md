abstract: This short paper describes problems arising in optical character recognition
  of and information retrieval from historical texts in languages with rich morphology,
  rather discontinuous lexical development and a long history of spelling reforms.
  In a work-in- progress manner, the problems and proposed linguistic solutions are
  shown on the example of the current project focused on improving the access to digitized
  Czech prints from the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century.
