abstract: This paper presents an approach for semi-automatic aggregation of knowledge
  on computer file formats used to support planning for long term preservation. Our
  goal is to create a solid knowledge base from linked open data repositories which
  represents the fundament of the DiPRec recommender system. The ontology mapping
  approach is employed for collecting the information and integrating it in a common
  domain model. Furthermore, we employ expert rules for inferring explicit knowledge
  on the nature and preservation friendliness of the file formats.
