abstract: This project explores the world of retrocomputing, a constellation of largely—though
  not exclusively—non-professional practices involving old computing technology. Retrocomputing
  includes many activities that can be seen as constituting “preservation,” and in
  particular digital preservation. At the same time, however, it is often transformative,
  producing assemblages that “remix” fragments from the past with newer elements or
  joining historic components that were never previously combined. While such “remix”
  may seem to undermine preservation, it allows for fragments of computing history
  to be reintegrated into a living, ongoing practice, contributing to preservation
  in a broader sense. The seemingly unorganized nature of retrocomputing assemblages
  also provides space for alternative “situated knowledges” and histories of computing,
  which can be quite sophisticated. Recognizing such alternative epistemologies in
  turn paves the way for alternative approaches to preservation. The institutional
  digital preservation community may have a lot to gain from paying closer attention
  to retrocomputing. This gain, however, should not just involve looking for ways
  to make use of the knowledge and labor of retrocomputing enthusiasts. Rather, it
  is important to recognize the value of their projects on their own terms and ask
  in what ways institutional efforts can support such projects.
