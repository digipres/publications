abstract: 'This paper aims to propose an ontology for the main digital preservation
  workflows carried out by an organization or an archival system. The proposed ontology
  covers the entire preservation life cycle, starting from the ingestion of digital
  resources and including internal functions, such as system administration and preservation
  planning policies, and access control. Fifty workflow models have been represented
  using the ontology, which takes into account the special characteristics and features
  specified by the international standards, as well as the existing metadata schemas
  for preservation. The proposed ontology supports the decision making of the collection
  managers, who design preservation policies and follow practices, by providing a
  knowledge-based tool able to guide, encode and

  (re)use their reasoning and choices.'
