abstract: Viewshare is a free, Library-of-Congress-sponsored platform that empowers
  historians, librarians, archivists and curators to create and customize dynamic
  interfaces to collections of digital content. This demonstration of Viewshare will
  start with an example spreadsheet or data harvested via OAI-PMH to generate distinct
  interactive visual interfaces (including maps, timelines, and sophisticated faceted
  navigation), which can be copy-pasted in any webpage. The data augmentation services
  associated with Viewshare will also be demonstrated.
