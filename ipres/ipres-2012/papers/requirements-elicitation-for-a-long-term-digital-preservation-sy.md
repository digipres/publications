abstract: 'Companies face challenges towards designing and implementing a preservation
  system to store the increasing amounts of digital data they produce and collect.
  The financial sector, in particular the investment business, is characterized by
  constantly increasing volumes of high frequency market and transaction data which
  need to be kept for long periods of time (e.g., due to regulatory compliance). Designing
  and developing a system ensuring long term preservation of digital data for this
  sector is a complex and difficult process. The work presented in this article has
  two main objectives: (1) to exhibit preservation challenges for the financial sector/
  investment business, and (2) to present and discuss preliminary results of the requirements
  elicitation process, with focus on the financial sector - work pursued towards the
  design and development of a preservation system, within the scope of the on-going
  R&D FP7 project ENSURE â€“ Enabling kNowledge Sustainability Usability and Recovery
  for Economic value (http://ensure-fp7.eu). Requirements, use cases and scenarios
  identified for the financial sector are presented and discussed. The agenda for
  future research work is also presented.'
