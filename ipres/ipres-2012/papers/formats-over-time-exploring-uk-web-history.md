abstract: Is software obsolescence a significant risk? To explore this issue, we analysed
  a corpus of over 2.5 billion resources cor- responding to the UK Web domain, as
  crawled between 1996 and 2010. Using the DROID and Apache Tika identification tools,
  we examined each resource and captured the results as extended MIME types, embedding
  version, software and hardware identifiers alongside the format information. The
  combined results form a detailed temporal format profile of the corpus, which we
  have made available as open data. We present the results of our initial analysis
  of this dataset. We look at image, HTML and PDF resources in some detail, showing
  how the usage of different formats, versions and software implementations has changed
  over time. Further- more, we show that software obsolescence is rare on the web
  and uncover evidence indicating that network effects act to stabilise formats against
  obsolescence.
