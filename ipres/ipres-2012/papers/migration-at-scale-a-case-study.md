abstract: 'Increasing experience in developing and maintaining large repositories
  of digital objects suggests that changes in the large- scale infrastructure of archives,
  their capabilities, and their communities of use, will themselves necessitate the
  ability to manage, manipulate, move, and migrate content at very large scales.

  Migration at scale of digital assets, whether those assets are deposited with the
  archive, or are created as preservation system artifacts by the archive, and whether
  migration is employed as a strategy for managing the risk of format obsolescence,
  for repository management, or for other reasons, is a challenge facing many large-scale
  digital archives and repositories.

  This paper explores the experience of Portico (www.portico.org), a not-for-profit
  digital preservation service providing a permanent archive of electronic journals,
  books, and other scholarly content, as it undertook a migration of the XML files
  that document the descriptive, technical, events, and structural metadata for approximately
  15 million e-journal articles in its archive. It describes the purpose, planning,
  technical challenges, and quality assurance demands associated with digital object
  migration at very large scales.'
