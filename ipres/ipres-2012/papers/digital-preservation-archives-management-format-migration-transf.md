abstract: 'In a recent scoping study we have inquired into the data management needs
  of several research groups at the Uni- versity of Porto and concluded that data
  quality and ease of on-line data manipulation are among the most valued features
  of a data repository. This paper describes the en- suing approach to data curation,
  designed to streamline the data depositing process and built on two components:
  a curation workflow and a data repository. The workflow in- volves a data curator
  who will assist researchers in provid- ing meaningful descriptions for their data,
  while a DSpace repository was customised to satisfy common data deposit and exploration
  requirements. Storing the datasets as XML documents, the repository allows curators
  to deposit new datasets using Excel spreadsheets as an intermediate for- mat, allowing
  the data to be queried on-line and the results retrieved in the same format. This
  dedicated repository pro- vides the grounds for collecting researcher feedback on
  the curation process.'
