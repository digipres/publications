abstract: In this paper, we discuss innovations by the Archivematica project as a
  response to the experiences of early implementers and informed by the greater archival,
  library, digital humanities and digital forensics communities. The Archivematica
  system is an implementation of the ISO-OAIS functional model and is designed to
  maintain standards-based, long-term access to collections of digital objects. Early
  deployments have revealed some limitations of the ISO-OAIS model in the areas of
  appraisal, arrangement, description, and preservation planning. The Archivematica
  project has added requirements intended to fill those gaps to its development roadmap
  for its micro-services architecture and web-based dashboard. Research and development
  is focused on managing indexed backlogs of transferred digital acquisitions, creating
  a SIP from a transfer or set of transfers, developing strategies for preserving
  email, and receiving updates about new normalization paths via a format policy registry
  (FPR).
