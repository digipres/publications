abstract: Digital preservation of (business) processes is an emerging topic in Digital
  Preservation research. Information technology driven processes are complex digital
  objects, living in an broad context of aspects relevant to their preservation. In
  this poster, we detail the broad environment of one sample process from the domain
  of E-Science, a genre classification experiment in the domain of Music Information
  Retrieval. We show the magnitude of aspects involved, on technology as well as organisational,
  legal and other aspects.
