abstract: The effective preservation of both current and historical scientific data
  will underpin a multitude of ecological, economic and political decisions that shape
  the future of our society. The SCIDIP-ES project addresses the long-term preservation
  of the knowledge encoded in scientific data by providing preservation e- infrastructure
  services which support the persistent storage, access and management needs. Using
  exemplars from the Earth Science domain we highlight the key preservation challenges
  and barriers to be overcome by the SCIDIP-ES infrastructure. SCIDIP-ES augments
  existing science data e-infrastructures by adding specific services and toolkits
  which implement core preservation concepts, thus guaranteeing the long-term access
  and exploitation of data assets across and beyond their designated communities.
