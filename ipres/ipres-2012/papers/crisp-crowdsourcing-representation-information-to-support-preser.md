abstract: 'In this paper, we describe a new collaborative approach to the

  collection of representation information to ensure long term access to digital content.
  Representation information is essential for successful rendering of digital content
  in the future. Manual

  collection and maintenance of RI has so far proven to be highly resource intensive
  and is compounded by the massive scale of the challenge, especially for repositories
  with no format limitations.

  This solution combats these challenges by drawing upon the wisdom and knowledge
  of the crowd to identify online sources of representation information, which are
  then collected, classified, and managed using existing tools. We suggest that nominations
  can be harvested and preserved by participating established web archives, which
  themselves could obviously benefit from such extensive collections. This is a low
  cost, low resource approach to collecting essential representation information of
  widespread relevance.'
