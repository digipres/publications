abstract: The majority of existing digital preservation solutions are focusing on
  the long-term storage of digital content such as documents, images, video, audio
  files and other domain specific data. Preservation of an Information Technology
  infrastructure for supporting business processes is a much more challenging task.
  It requires the preservation of software and hardware stacks as well as relevant
  contexts, which together, provide an execution layer for running business processes.
  The proposed TIMBUS architecture addresses limitations of existing digital preservation
  solutions and provides a complete framework for preserving business processes implemented
  upon a service oriented architecture.
