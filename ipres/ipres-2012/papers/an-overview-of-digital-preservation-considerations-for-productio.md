abstract: In the Indian context, when the e-government records are received for archival
  purpose, it is observed that very often they are produced without proper compliances
  for long term digital preservation. This paper presents a case study of e-district
  Mission Mode Project which offers diverse citizen services and produces the e-records
  such as birth certificates, domicile certificates, marriage certificates, caste
  certificates, etc in very large volumes. Such born digital e-government records
  have to be retained and preserved for technological and legal reasons. The Centre
  of Excellence for Digital Preservation established at C- DAC, Pune, India has carried
  out the study of e-record production process in the e-district and the need analysis
  for its digital preservation. The digital preservation best practices are identified,
  which have to be incorporated in the production process of e- records, so that the
  final e-records are produced in “preservable” form with full compliance as per the
  requirements of OAIS.
