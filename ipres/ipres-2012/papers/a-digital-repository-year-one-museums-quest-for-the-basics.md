abstract: The Computer History Museum (CHM) had its own mini deluge of digital data.
  Our in-house produced high definition oral histories, lectures and exhibition videos
  were usurping our available server space at over 60 terabytes, with another 10 terabytes
  of historic digital artifacts including images and software. With the aid of grant
  funds from Google.org, CHM took on the work of creating a prototype digital repository
  in one year. The digital repository working group is excited about the possibilities
  the new repository represents for expanding our digital collection while putting
  the Museum in the forefront of small cultural institutions creating digital repositories
  and we hope to share what we have learned with other similar organizations.
