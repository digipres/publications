abstract: This paper conveys findings from four years of research conducted by the
  MetaArchive Cooperative, the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations
  (NDLTD), and the University of North Texas to investigate and document how academic
  institutions may best ensure that the electronic theses and dissertations they acquire
  from students today will be available to future researchers.
