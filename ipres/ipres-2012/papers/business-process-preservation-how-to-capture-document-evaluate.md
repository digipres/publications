abstract: Preserved digital data is often of limited use and value, due to the unavailability
  of the environment where the data has been generated, executed, analysed, and presented.
  The preservation of complete processes, including the supporting infrastructure,
  raises a number of new challenges. In highly computerized firms, processes are often
  based on service oriented architectures with services provided by third parties.
  Digital preservation of business processes requires keeping the data, software services
  and infrastructure available for long time spans. The strong intra- and interdependencies
  of components make modification and adoption for preservation highly complex. Besides
  the technical challenges, the organisation and legal aspects of a process need to
  be considered as well. Contracts for external services, licences for software, access
  rights to business data and national data regulations for sensible data have to
  be taken into account when preserving complex information systems. The TIMBUS project
  targets the research and development of methods and tools for preserving business
  processes over time. This poster presents a phased phases approach and the processes
  to capture and identify the relevant context, plan preservation actions and execute
  and store business process for the future.
