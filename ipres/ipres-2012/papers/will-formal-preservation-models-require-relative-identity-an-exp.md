abstract: 'The problem of identifying and re–identifying data put the notion of of
  ”same data” at the very heart of preservation, integration and interoperability,
  and many other fundamental data curation activities. However, it is also a profoundly
  challenging notion because the concept of data itself clearly lacks a precise and
  univocal definition. When science is con- ducted in small communicating groups,
  with homogeneous data these ambiguities seldom create problems and solutions can
  be negotiated in casual real-time conversations. However when the data is heterogeneous
  in encoding, con- tent and management practices, these problems can produce costly
  inefficiencies and lost opportunities. We consider here the relative identity view
  which apparently provides the most natural interpretation of common identity statements
  about digitally–encoded data. We show how this view conflicts with the curatorial
  and management practice of “data” objects, in terms of their modeling, and common
  knowledge representation strategies.


  In what follows we focus on a single class of identity statements about digitally–encoded
  data: “same data but in a different format”. As a representative example of the
  use of this kind of statements consider the dataset “Federal Data Center Consolidation
  Initiative (FDCCI) Data Center Closings 2010-2013”1 , available at Data.gov. Anyone
  can “Down- load a copy of this dataset in a static format”. The available formats
  include CSV, RDF, RSS, XLS, and XML. Each of this is presumably an encoding of the
  “same data”. We explore three approaches to formalization into first order logic
  and for each we identify distinctive tradeoffs for preservation models. Our analysis
  further motivates the development of a system that will provide a comprehensive
  treatment of data concepts. '
