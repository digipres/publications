abstract: 'Emulation evolves into a mature digital preservation strategy providing
  authentic access to a wide range of digital objects using their original creation
  environments. In contrast to migration, an emulation approach requires a number
  of additional components, namely the full software-stack required to render a digital
  object, and its configuration. Thus, independent of which emulator is chosen, contextual
  information of the original computer environment is always needed.

  To overcome this knowledge gap, a formalization process is required to identify
  the actual building blocks for an authentic rendering environment of a given object.
  While the information gathering workflow relies heavily on user knowledge and manual
  interaction during ingest, the workflow is coupled with a feedback loop so that
  both a complete emulation environment and preservation of desired properties for
  later access are ensured.'
