abstract: Digital preservation research has increasingly been shifting focus from
  the preservation of data and static objects to investigate the preservation of complete
  processes and workflows. Capturing all aspects of a process to be preserved, however,
  is an extensive and difficult undertaking, as it requires capturing complete software
  setups with potentially complex setups. Further, the process might use external
  services that are not easy to capture and monitor. In this paper, we therefore investigate
  the applicability and usability of using Workflow Management Systems for executing
  processes in a standard environment where the state of the process can be closely
  monitored. To this end, we compare three popular workflow management systems. We
  use a scenario from eScience, implementing a data analysis process, to evaluate
  the challenges and implications for establishing sustainable and verifiable eScience
  processes.
