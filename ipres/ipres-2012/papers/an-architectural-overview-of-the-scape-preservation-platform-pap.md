abstract: Cloud and data-intensive computing technologies have introduced novel methods
  to develop virtualized and scalable applications. The SCAPE Preservation Platform
  is an environment that leverages cloud computing in order to overcome scalability
  limitations in the context of digital preservation. In this paper, we provide an
  overview of the platform architecture and its system requirements. Furthermore,
  we present a flexible deployment model that can be used to dynamically reconfigure
  the system and provide initial insights on employing an open-source cloud platform
  for its realization.
