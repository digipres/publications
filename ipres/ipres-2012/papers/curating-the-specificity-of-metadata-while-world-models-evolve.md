abstract: 'The main digital preservation strategies are based on metadata

  and in many cases SemanticWeb languages, like RDF/S, are used for expressing them.
  However RDF/S schemas or ontologies are not static, but evolve. This evolution usually
  happens independently of the “metadata” (ontological instance descriptions) which
  are stored in the various Metadata Repositories (MRs) or Knowledge Bases (KBs).
  Nevertheless,

  it is a common practice for a MR/KB to periodically update its ontologies to their
  latest versions by “migrating” the available instance descriptions to the latest
  ontology versions. Such migrations incur gaps regarding the specificity of the migrated
  metadata, i.e. inability to distinguish those descriptions that should be reexamined
  (for possible specialization as consequence of the migration) from those for which
  no reexamination is justified. Consequently, there is a need for principles, techniques,
  and tools for managing the uncertainty incurred by such migrations, specifically
  techniques for (a) identifying automatically the descriptions that are candidate
  for specialization, (b) computing, ranking and recommending possible specializations,
  and (c) flexible interactive techniques for updating the available descriptions
  (and their candidate specializations), after the user (curator of the repository)
  accepts/rejects such recommendations. This problem is especially important for curated
  knowledge bases which have increased quality requirements (as in e-Science). In
  this paper we elaborate on this problem, we propose a general approach, and discuss
  examples and a prototype application that we have developed assuming the RFD/S framework.'
