abstract: 'Preserving a full computer system for long-term access is in some cases
  the option of last resort. In these situations the system consists of complex workflows
  and tool-chains paired with custom configuration such that the dismantling of individual
  components is too time consuming or even impossible to be carried out. For such
  situations a defined system-preservation workflow is required, ideally integrated
  into a digital preservation framework to ensure future rendering ability and quality.

  This demonstration presents an integrated system-preservation workflow, designed
  to be performed by non-technical users and to ensure long-term access (e.g. through
  emulation) with guaranteed system properties. Furthermore, the workflow leverages
  a distributed framework, enabling on-site preservation tasks, while making use of
  a common shared knowledge base and ready-made access preview technologies.'
