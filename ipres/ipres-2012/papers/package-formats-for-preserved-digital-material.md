abstract: 'This paper presents an investigation of the best suitable package formats
  for long term digital preservation. The choice of a package format for preservation
  is crucial for future access, thus a thorough analysis of choice is important.

  The investigation presented here covers setting up requirements for package formats
  used for long term preserved digital material, and using these requirements as the
  basis for analysing a range of package formats.

  The result of the concrete investigation is that the WARC format is the package
  format best suited for the listed requirements. Fulfilling the listed requirements
  will ensure mitigating a number of risks of information loss. Thus WARC is the best
  choice for a package format in cases where these same risks are judged most

  important. Similar analysis will need to be carried out in cases where the requirements
  differ from the ones described here, e.g. if there are specific forensic or direct
  access to files.'
