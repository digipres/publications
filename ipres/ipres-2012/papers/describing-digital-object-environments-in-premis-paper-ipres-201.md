abstract: “Digital preservation metadata” is the information that is needed in order
  to preserve digital objects successfully in the longterm so that they can be deployed
  in some form in the future. A digital object is not usable without a computing environment
  in which it can be rendered or executed. Because of this, information that describes
  the sufficient components of the digital object’s computing environment has to be
  part of its preservation metadata. Although there are semantic units for recording
  environment information in PREMIS 2, these have rarely, if ever, been used. Prompted
  by increasing interest in the description of computing environments, this paper
  describes on-going efforts within the PREMIS data dictionary’s Editorial Committee
  to define an improved metadata description for them.
