abstract: 'Digital Libraries (DL) have been made possible through the integration
  and use of a number of IC technologies, the availability of digital content on a
  global scale and a strong demand for users who are now online. They are destined
  to become essential part of the information infrastructure in the 21st century.
  The DELOS network intends to conduct a joint program of activities aimed at integrating
  and coordinating the ongoing research activities of the major European teams working
  in DL-related areas with the goal of developing the next generation DL technologies.

  This talk will provide an overview of the seven Research Clusters within the DELOS
  Network, with a specific focus on activities of the DELOS Preservation Cluster.'
