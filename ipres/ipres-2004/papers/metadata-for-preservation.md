abstract: In recent years there have been a range of metadata specifications and frameworks
  developed to support digital preservation activities. These range from formats that
  are intended to be specific to certain types of resources to generic frameworks
  based on the information model defined by the Reference Model for an Open Archival
  Information System (OAIS). Those specifications that exist have been developed from
  the perspective of a variety of different professional domains and world-views.
  The presentation will attempt to define preservation metadata, introduce some of
  the most important schemas and standards being developed, and outline some of the
  problems that result from the differing perspectives that inform their development.
