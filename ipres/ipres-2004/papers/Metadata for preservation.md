title: 'Metadata for preservation'
abstract: In recent years there have been a range of metadata specifications and frameworks developed to support digital preservation activities. These range from formats that are intended to be specific to certain types of resources to generic frameworks based on the information model defined by the Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS). Those specifications that exist have been developed from the perspective of a variety of different professional domains and world-views. The presentation will attempt to define preservation metadata, introduce some of the most important schemas and standards being developed, and outline some of the problems that result from the differing perspectives that inform their development.
