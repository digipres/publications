title: 'Preservation Strategies of the Koninklijke Bibliotheek'
abstract: 'As a deposit library, the National Library of the Netherlands (KB) was faced with having to store digital publications already more than ten years ago. As the number of digital publications was growing, the KB decided to make digital preservation one of its main concerns. This resulted, among other things, in an operational digital archive (the e-Depot) and projects to develop preservation functionality. In this presentation two projects will be explained in more detail: the Preservation Manager, a tool for the monitoring of technical metadata, and the Universal Virtual Computer for JPEG. This UVC is a new approach for the rendering of digital objects, without depending on current platforms or formats. Together with IBM, we developed a first working UVC, which will be demonstrated.'
