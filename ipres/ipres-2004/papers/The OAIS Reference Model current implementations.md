title: 'The OAIS Reference Model: current implementations'
abstract: The OAIS Reference Model (ISO 14721:2003) is an important part of the current digital preservation landscape. Initially developed by the Consultative Committee on Space Data Systems, the OAIS establishes a common framework of terms and concepts, identifies the basic functions of an archival system, and provides an information model for managing digital objects and information packages. The OAIS information model has proved to be extremely influential on the development of preservation metadata schemas. While the OAIS Reference Model does NOT specify any implementation, it has informed the implementation of some preservation systems, including the National Library of the Netherlands deposit system. This presentation will provide an introduction to the OAIS Reference Model and highlight some recent implementations that have been informed by it.
