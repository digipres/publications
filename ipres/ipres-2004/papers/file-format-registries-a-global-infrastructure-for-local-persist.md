abstract: 'Cooperation has always been essential in the digital preservation community
  regarding knowledge exchange and collaboration in research activities. As initiatives
  increasingly turn to implementation, cooperation also gains practical significance.
  Initiatives embark on collaboratively building services that are required by various
  preservation systems.

  This presentation addresses file format registries. The preservation community jointly
  calls for a register that identifies and documents file formats, to come to terms
  with the myriad of different file formats. Activities towards building a file format
  registry are emerging, as already some preservation initiatives rely on such a future
  service in their current approaches.'
