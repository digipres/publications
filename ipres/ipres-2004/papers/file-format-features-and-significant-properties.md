abstract: The notion "significant properties" in digital preservation can be paraphrased
  as the features of digital objects that need to be preserved. The definition of
  significant properties at the inception of a digital preservation programme will
  guide an organisation in choosing the preservation method suited for their specific
  requirements. However, the definition of significant properties and the preservation
  of the object are constrained by a file format's inherent features. The presentation
  introduces the notions 'file format features' and 'significant properties', discusses
  their relation and discusses their role in a successful long-term preservation effort.
