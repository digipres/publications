abstract: The OAIS Reference Model (ISO 14721:2003) is an important part of the current
  digital preservation landscape. Initially developed by the Consultative Committee
  on Space Data Systems, the OAIS establishes a common framework of terms and concepts,
  identifies the basic functions of an archival system, and provides an information
  model for managing digital objects and information packages. The OAIS information
  model has proved to be extremely influential on the development of preservation
  metadata schemas. While the OAIS Reference Model does NOT specify any implementation,
  it has informed the implementation of some preservation systems, including the National
  Library of the Netherlands deposit system. This presentation will provide an introduction
  to the OAIS Reference Model and highlight some recent implementations that have
  been informed by it.
