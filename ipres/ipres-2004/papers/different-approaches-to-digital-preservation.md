abstract: 'Digital preservation consists of three subjects: safe storage, preservation
  metadata and permanent access. First we have to make sure digital objects are stored
  on secure storage media and are maintained by proper procedures for safety, back-up
  and refreshment. In order to be able to retrieve the stored objects, we have to
  register information on the objects in preservation metadata and work on the technical
  possibilities to render the stored objects, now and in the future. To work on permanent
  access solutions, a number of questions have to be answered about what it is we
  want to view and use in the future. Different strategies can be deployed, each with
  their own advantages and disadvantages. In this presentation these strategies will
  be explained and linked to their intended use and their possibilities, including
  examples. Apart from existing strategies, new procedures and especially tools will
  have to be tested and developed to keep our digital archives accessible. Research
  and development on permanent access requires continuous effort and internation co-operation.'
