abstract: Should we preserve everything or only a selection of the available information?
  This is the question which will be illuminated from different point of view within
  this talk. Institutions all around the world are developing strategies and policies
  for preservation. Many developments are done in parallel redundantly, some are still
  open. This talk will give a brief overview of the activities (in selection) and
  the solutions they developed or the state of discussion process. This overview is
  part of the project "nestor" http://www.langzeitarchivierung.de/index.php?newlang=eng
  supported by the Germany Ministry for Education and Research.
