abstract: Preservation of "Primary Data" is of very high relevance in science. While
  letter publications become redundant by review publications over the years, and
  while review articles are remembered by many readers, primary data often can not
  be reconstructed. Primary data as there is e.g. weather data, accelerator data,
  space observation data, build the backbone of scientific research and publication
  activities. It is essentially required to reconstruct experiments, to recalculate
  final results in scientific publications and to check their correctness. The existence
  of primary data makes the difference between fiction and science. Primary data often
  is open for re-usage in other research activities, e.g. measurement of the radius
  of the proton at CERN. This talk will offer an overview of the relevance of primary
  data in natural science, of its preservation requirements, and how it is preserved
  today.
