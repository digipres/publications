abstract: 'Long-term preservation solutions become critical as an increasing amount
  of information is being digitized or directly created and thus existing only in
  electronic form. While different approaches, such as Emulation, Migration, or Computer
  Museums, are being proposed as solutions to this challenge, neither of them excels
  in all circumstances. Selection of the most appropriate strategy and tools becomes
  a non-trivial task.

  In this talk we present an adapted version of Utility Analysis, which can be applied
  to selecting the optimal preservation solution for each individual situation. This
  analysis method, which is usually applied in infrastructure projects, such as highways,
  airports, or city district development, is here used to combine the wide range of
  requirements, which are to be considered in order to select a suitable preservation
  strategy. Additionally, we present a framework for identifying and defining the
  criteria influencing the choice of a particular preservation solution, such as a
  specific migration tool. The evaluation metric is explained theoretically and demonstrated
  via case-studies performed for different application domains.'
