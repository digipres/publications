title: 'DELOS: Network of Excellence on Digital Libraries, with a focus on the Preservation Cluster'
abstract: |-
  Digital Libraries (DL) have been made possible through the integration and use of a number of IC technologies, the availability of digital content on a global scale and a strong demand for users who are now online. They are destined to become essential part of the information infrastructure in the 21st century. The DELOS network intends to conduct a joint program of activities aimed at integrating and coordinating the ongoing research activities of the major European teams working in DL-related areas with the goal of developing the next generation DL technologies.
  This talk will provide an overview of the seven Research Clusters within the DELOS Network, with a specific focus on activities of the DELOS Preservation Cluster.
