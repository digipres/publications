title: 'File Format Features and Significant Properties'
abstract: The notion "significant properties" in digital preservation can be paraphrased as the features of digital objects that need to be preserved. The definition of significant properties at the inception of a digital preservation programme will guide an organisation in choosing the preservation method suited for their specific requirements. However, the definition of significant properties and the preservation of the object are constrained by a file format's inherent features. The presentation introduces the notions 'file format features' and 'significant properties', discusses their relation and discusses their role in a successful long-term preservation effort.
