abstract: Today's scholarly works can be dynamic, distributed, and complex. They can
  consist of multiple related components (article, dataset, software, multimedia,
  webpage, etc.) that are made available asynchronously, assigned a range of identifiers,
  and stored in different repositories with uneven preservation policies. A lot of
  progress has been made to simplify the process of sharing the components of these
  new forms of scholarly output and to improve the methods of preserving diverse formats.
  As the complexity of a scholarly works grows, however, it becomes unlikely that
  all of the components will become available at the same time, be accessible through
  a single repository, or even stay in the same state as they were at the time of
  publication. In turn, it also becomes more challenging to maintain a comprehensive
  and current perspective on what the complete work consists of and where all of the
  components can be found. It is this challenge that makes it valuable to also capture
  and preserve the map of relationships amongst these distributed resources. The goal
  of the RMap project was to build a prototype service that can capture and preserve
  the maps of relationships found amongst these distributed works. The outcomes of
  the RMap project and its possible applications for preservation are described.
