abstract: 'This 3-hour tutorial focuses on the practical problems in ingesting, preserving
  and reusing content maintained in relational databases. The tutorial is based on
  practical experiences from European national archives and provides an outlook into
  the future of database preservation based on the work undertaken in collaboration
  by the EC-funded E-ARK project1 and the Swiss Federal Archives2. This tutorial relates
  closely to the workshop: “Relational database preservation standards and tools”
  which provides hands-on experience on the SIARD database preservation format and
  appropriate software tools.'
