abstract: The Database Preservation Toolkit is a software that automates the migration
  of a relational database to the second version of the Software Independent Archiving
  of Relational Databases format. This exible tool supports the currently most popular
  Relational Database Management Systems and can also convert a preserved database
  back to a Database Management System, allowing for some specific usage scenarios
  in an archival context. The conversion of databases between different formats, whilst
  retaining the databases' significant properties, poses a number of interesting implementation
  issues, which are described along with their current solutions. To complement the
  conversion software, the Database Visualization Toolkit is introduced as a software
  that allows access to preserved databases, enabling a consumer to quickly search
  and explore a database without knowing any query language. The viewer is capable
  of handling big databases and promptly present search and filter results on millions
  of records. This paper describes the features of both tools and the methods used
  to pilot them in the context of the European Archival Records and Knowledge Preservation
  project on several European national archives.
