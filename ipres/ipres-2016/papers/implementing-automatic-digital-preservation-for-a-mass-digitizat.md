abstract: "The Saxon State and University Library Dresden (SLUB) has built up its
  digital preservation system SLUBArchiv from 2012 to 2014. In January 2015, we launched
  the preservation workflow for digitized documents. This workflow extends the in-house
  mass digitization workflow, which is based on the software Kitodo.Production. In
  this paper, we describe the three major challenges we faced while extending our
  mass digitization workflow with an automatic preparation and ingest into our digital
  long-term preservation system and the solutions we found. These challenges have
  been \n(1) validating and checking not only the target file format of the scanning
  process but also the constraints to it, \n(2) handling updates of digital documents
  that have already been submitted to the digital long-term preservation system, and
  \n(3) checking the integrity of the archived data as a whole in a comprehensive
  but affordable fashion.\n"
