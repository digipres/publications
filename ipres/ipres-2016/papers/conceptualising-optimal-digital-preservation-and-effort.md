abstract: In this paper we describe the National Library of New Zealand’s attempts
  to conceptualise how we measure the degrees of effort required to achieve acceptable
  levels of digital preservation. We argue that understanding digital preservation
  practice in terms of “optimal effort” may help us conceptualise where and how best
  to achieve the greatest impact in proportion to effort. The paper examines the various
  roles of digital preservation, including the archival/curatorial, digital object
  handling, preservation management, and policy roles through case studies of our
  experience. We argue that through conceptualising our ideal digital preservation
  and the levels of effort required to achieve those, we will be able to better understand
  where our effort is being expended and the levels of preservation we are achieving.
