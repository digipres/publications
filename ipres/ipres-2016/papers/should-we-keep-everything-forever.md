abstract: The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's library-based Research
  Data Service (RDS) launched an institutional data repository called the Illinois
  Data Bank (IDB) in May 2016. The RDS makes a commitment to preserving and facilitating
  access to published research datasets for a minimum of five years after the date
  of publication in the Illinois Data Bank. The RDS has developed guidelines and processes
  for reviewing published datasets after their five-year commitment ends to determine
  whether to retain, deaccession, or dedicate more stewardship resources to datasets.
  In this poster, we will describe how the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
  preservation review planning team drew upon appraisal and reappraisal theory and
  practices from the archives community to develop preservation review processes and
  guidelines for datasets published in the Illinois Data Bank.
