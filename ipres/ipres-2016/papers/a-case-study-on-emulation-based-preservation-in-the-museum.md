abstract: We use emulation to preserve a complex digital artifact in the museum. We
  describe all stages of the preservation process and discuss the technical and curatorial
  problems that we encountered. The exhibition setting defines additional requirements
  for an emulation. Our findings and lessons learned are instructive for emulation
  researchers and museum practitioners. The preserved artifact now is on display in
  real exhibitions.
