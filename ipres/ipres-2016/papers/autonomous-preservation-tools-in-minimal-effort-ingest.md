abstract: This poster presents the concept of Autonomous Preservation Tools, as developed
  by the State and University Library, Denmark. The work expands the idea of Minimal
  E_ort Ingest, where most preservation actions such as Quality Assurance and enrichment
  of the digital objects are performed after content is ingested for preservation,
  rather than before. We present our Newspaper Digitisation Project as a case- study
  of real-world implementations of Autonomous Preser- vation Tools.
