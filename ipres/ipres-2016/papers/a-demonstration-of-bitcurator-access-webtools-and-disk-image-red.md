abstract: 'BitCurator Access is developing open-source software that supports the
  provision of access to disk images through three exploratory approaches: (1) building
  tools to support web-based services, (2) enabling the export of file systems and
  associated metadata, (3) and the use of emulation environments. This demonstration
  will highlight two BitCurator Access software products: BitCurator Access Webtools
  which supports browser-based search and navigation over data from disk images, and
  a set of scripts to redact sensitive data from disk images.'
