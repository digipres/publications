abstract: This paper describes the processes which led to the creation of an innovative
  interface to access a digital archive composed of two Swiss newspapers, namely Gazette
  de Lausanne (1798–1998) and Journal de Gen`eve (1826–1998). Based on several textual
  processing steps, including lexical indexation, n-grams computation and named entity
  recognition, a general purpose web-based application was designed and implemented
  ; it allows a large variety of users (e.g. historians, journalists, linguists and
  the general public) to explore different facets of about 4 million press articles
  spanning an almost 200 hundred years period.
