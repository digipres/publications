abstract: Personal Digital Archiving (PDA) is a relatively recent topic in the landscape
  of digital preservation and new questions/challenges arise as devices, tools, and
  apps to capture and share information seem to appear every day. Individuals and
  community organizations can be overwhelmed with photos, email messages, texts, letters,
  and a wide array of other materials. This workshop seeks to discuss ways in which
  cultural heritage institutions such as libraries, archives, and museums, along with
  university researchers, and software and systems developers in this domain, can
  help individuals and groups come to grips with their digital collections and preserve
  content that is important to their lives, organizations, communities, and heritage
  in trustworthy, long-term ways. Very few initiatives are on-going worldwide on this
  topic, one of the most relevant, the PDA conference in the US, is presented to bring
  the discussion to Europe. Cultural heritage organizations that are building trustworthy
  digital repositories along with tool builders and software/system developers have
  much to offer in this arena but roles and responsibilities as well as incentives
  and resources must be established. At the most fundamental stage, awareness needs
  to be raised among all stakeholders and guidelines to help individuals and organizations
  need to be developed, maintained, and disseminated. Of prime concern at this juncture
  is how public institutions such as libraries and archives can help community organizations
  and individuals?
