abstract: The availability and accessibility of digital artworks is closely tied to
  a technical platform, which becomes quickly unavailable due to a fast technical
  life-cycle. One approach to keep digital artworks performing is to replace physical
  hardware parts with emulation. Preparing an emulator to publicly display digital
  art is typically time-consuming and, more importantly, usually done on a case-by-case
  basis, making each installation a unique and costly e_ort. We present an adaptation
  of the Emulation as a Service framework to be deployed on a self-contained USB-stick,
  booting directly into a prepared emulated environment. Furthermore, we report from
  practical experiences using the system in two museum exhibitions.
