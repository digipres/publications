abstract: This poster outlines my research on strategies of re-enactment to keep alive
  artworks that rely on performance. While digital documentation for some of these
  works circulates, the live nature of the works means they evade meaningful digitisation.
  In an artist/archivist collaboration, Teaching and Learning Cinema, myself and colleague
  Dr Lucas Ihlein have evolved three principal ways to bring these works from the
  original artists through to future generations â€“ direct engagement with the original
  artist, extensive documentation of the reenactment process and the formulation of
  new 'expressive' instructions. This approach resonates with a newly ignited discussion
  in Australia about how the conservation profession can effectively reach beyond
  institutions to communities. This work suggests that empowering communities to find
  their own solutions to intergenerational transmission means the process of preservation
  becomes part of the cultural product, a preservation of doing.
