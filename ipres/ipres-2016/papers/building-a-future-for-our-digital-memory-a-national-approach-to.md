abstract: 'In 2015 the national Network for Digital Heritage was established. This
  network is based on three pillars: to make the digital heritage wider visible, better
  usable and more sustainable preserved. A series of collaborative projects are in
  progress since Summer 2015, framed within three working programs, all with their
  own but integrated set of dedicated actions in order to create a national infrastructure
  in the Netherlands, based on an optimal use of existing facilities. In this paper
  the focus is on the activities related to the sustainable preservation of the Dutch
  national digital heritage. What are the developments and where are we now, with
  the program running for a year and the first results are delivered.'
