abstract: Virtualization and emulation provide the technical basis for a potential
  preservation strategy to keep performing digital objects accessible, despite obsolescence
  of their original technical platform. By simulating the presence of physical components,
  in the form of virtual hardware, it is possible to maintain the software environments
  needed to run original software. In this paper we describe a conceptual model to
  analyse and document the hardware and software elements of software-based artworks,
  in order to then identify dependencies and assess risks. This information is used
  to select the most appropriate options when creating disk images, and to make decisions
  about whether an emulation or virtualization platform is more appropriate in supporting
  these disk images. We conclude with recommendations for ensuring the sustainability
  of disk images in the medium-to-long-term, and strategies to mitigate the risks
  related to external dependencies.
