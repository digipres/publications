abstract: Memory institutions face increasing volumes of electronic documents and
  other media content for long term preservation. Data are normally stored in specific
  formats for documents, images, sound, video, etc., produced by software from different
  vendors. This software is controlled neither by the institution producing the files,
  nor by the institution that archives it. This obligates memory institutions to carry
  out conformance tests before accepting transfers of electronic collections, but
  again these are beyond the control of the institution and can be unreliable. This
  poses problems for long-term preservation. Digital content, meant for preservation,
  passing through an uncontrolled generative process can jeopardise the preservation
  process. The objective of PREFORMA (PREservation FORMAts for culture information/e-archives)
  – a Pre Commercial Procurement project co-funded by the European Commission under
  its FP7-ICT Programme – is to give memory institutions full control of the conformance
  testing of files created, migrated and ingested into archives. This is achieved
  through the development of open source tools which enable this process within an
  iteration that is under the full control of memory institutions. The project aims
  to establish a sustainable ecosystem involving interested stakeholders from a variety
  of backgrounds, including researchers, developers and memory institutions. The workshop
  will present the results of the project, including demonstration of the conformance
  checkers developed during the prototyping phase. This will inform a discussion with
  the digital preservation community – open source community, developers, standardization
  bodies and memory institutions – about the opportunities offered by PREFORMA and
  the challenges that are still to be addressed.
