abstract: Information Governance as defined by Gartner is the “specification of decision
  rights and an accountability framework to encourage desirable behavior in the valuation,
  creation, storage, use, archival and deletion of information. Includes the processes,
  roles, standards and metrics that ensure the effective and efficient use of information
  in enabling an organization to achieve its goals”. In this paper, we present assess
  the maturity of seven project pilots using the Information Governance maturity model
  based on existing reference documents. The process is based on existing maturity
  model development methods. These methods allow for a systematic approach to maturity
  model development backed up by a well-known and proved scientific research method
  called Design Science Research. An assessment was conducted and the results are
  presented in this paper, this assessment was conducted as a self-assessment in the
  context of the EC-funded E-ARK project for the seven pilots of the project. The
  main conclusion from this initial assessment is that there is much room for improvement
  with most pilots achieving results between maturity level two and three. As future
  work, the goal is to analyze other references from different domains, such as, records
  management. These references will enhance, detail and help develop the maturity
  model making it even more valuable for all types of organization that deal with
  information governance.
