abstract: The concept of digital sustainability introduces a holistic approach on
  how to maximize the benefits of digital resources for our society. The nine basic
  conditions for digital sustainability also provide a contribution to potential solutions
  to the challenges of digital preservation. Elaborateness, transparent structures,
  semantic data, distributed location, an open licensing regime, shared tacit knowledge,
  participatory culture, good governance, and diversified funding support the long-term
  availability of digital knowledge. Therefore, in this conceptual paper, we explain
  the links between digital sustainability and digital preservation in order to increase
  the impact of both. We conclude by presenting the political agenda of the Swiss
  parliamentary group for digital sustainability.
