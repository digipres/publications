abstract: This tutorial will prepare participants to use the open-source BitCurator
  environment and BitCurator Access Webtools to acquire, process and provide access
  to born-digital materials. There will be a brief lecture and discussion that focuses
  on the motivation for using the tools and several foundational technical concepts.
  The remainder of the tutorial will be devoted to demonstration and hands-on exercises
  that feature specific tools and methods. Participants will learn how to mount media
  as read-only, create disk images, mount forensically packaged disk images, export
  individual files or entire directories from disk images, use specialized scripts
  to perform batch activities, generate and interpret Digital Forensics XML (DFXML),
  generate a variety of standard and customized reports (including PREMIS records),
  identify various forms of sensitive data within collections, and provide browser-based
  search and navigation of files and folders.
