abstract: In this paper we describe the services that are offered by CERN [3] for
  Long Term preservation of High Energy Physics (HEP) data, with the Large Hadron
  Collider (LHC) as a key use case. Data preservation is a strategic goal for European
  High Energy Physics (HEP) [9], as well as for the HEP community worldwide and we
  position our work in this global content. Specifically, we target the preservation
  of the scientific data, together with the software, documentation and computing
  environment needed to process, (re-)analyse or otherwise (re-)use the data. The
  target data volumes range from hundreds of petabytes (PB – 1015 bytes) to hundreds
  of exabytes (EB – 1018 bytes) for a target duration of several decades. The Use
  Cases driving data preservation are presented together with metrics that allow us
  to measure how close we are to meeting our goals, including the possibility for
  formal certification for at least part of this work. Almost all of the services
  that we describe are fully generic – the exception being Analysis Preservation that
  has some domain-specific aspects (where the basic technology could nonetheless be
  adapted).
