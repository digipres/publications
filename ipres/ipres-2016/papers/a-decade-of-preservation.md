abstract: This paper provides a historical look at the technical migrations of the
  Chronopolis digital preservation system over the last ten years. During that time
  span the service has undergone several software system migrations, moving from middleware-based
  systems to a suite of individual, finely scoped components which employ widely used
  and standardized technologies. These transitions have enabled the system to become
  not only less dependent on interpretation by middleware, but also easier to transfer
  to new storage components. Additionally, the need for specialized software knowledge
  is alleviated; any Linux systems administrator should be able to install, configure,
  and run the software services with minimal guidance. The benefits of moving to a
  microservices approach have been instrumental in ensuring the longevity of the system
  through staff and organizational changes.
