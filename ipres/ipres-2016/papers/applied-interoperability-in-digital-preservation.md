abstract: "This paper describes the interoperability solutions which have been developed
  in the context of the E-ARK project. The project has, since February 2014, tackled
  the need for more interoperability and collaboration between preservation organizations.
  The solutions being developed include harmonized specifications for Submission,
  Archival and Dissemination Information Packages; and pre-ingest and access workflows.
  Furthermore, the specifications have been implemented using a range of software
  tools and piloted in real-life scenarios in various European archival institutions.
  \nThis paper provides a statement on the need for interoperability, and an overview
  of the necessary specifications and tools, and it calls for preservation organizations
  to continue collaboration beyond the lifetime of the E-ARK project.\n"
