abstract: The National Diet Library (NDL) has been providing access to digitized library
  materials via the Internet since 2002. The NDL has been digitizing books and magazines
  continuously since then, and collecting digitized materials from other institutions.
  In addition to digitized materials, NDL began to collect online publications (electronic
  books and electronic magazines) that were not protected by Digital Rights Management
  (DRM) from the Internet in 2013. The NDL Digital Collections was launched in 2011
  to collect, preserve, and distribute these materials. This paper provides an overview
  of the NDL Digital Collections and discusses current achievements as well as the
  challenges faced in effecting long-term preservation while meeting the functional
  requirements of the OAIS reference model.
