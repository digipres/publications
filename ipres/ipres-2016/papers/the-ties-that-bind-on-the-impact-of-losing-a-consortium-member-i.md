abstract: 'Cooperatively operated digital preservation systems offer institutions
  of varying size the chance to actively participate in digital preservation. In current
  times of budget cuts they are also a valuable asset to larger memory institutions.
  While the benefits of cooperatively operated systems have been discussed before,
  the risks associated with a consortial solution have not been analyzed in detail.
  TIB hosts the Goportis Digital Archive which is used by two large national subject
  libraries as well as by TIB itself. As the host of this comparatively small preservation
  network, TIB has started to analyze the particular risk which losing a consortium
  member poses to the overall system operation. This paper presents the current status
  of this work-in-progress and highlights two areas: risk factors associated with
  cost and risk factors associated with the content. While the paper is strictly written
  from the viewpoint of the consortial leader/ host of this specific network, the
  underlying processes shall be beneficial to other cooperatively operated digital
  preservation systems.'
