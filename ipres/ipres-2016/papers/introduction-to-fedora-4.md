abstract: Fedora is a flexible, extensible, open source repository platform for managing,
  preserving, and providing access to digital content. Fedora is used in a wide variety
  of institutions including libraries, museums, archives, and government organizations.
  Fedora 4 introduces native linked data capabilities and a modular architecture based
  on welldocumented APIs and ease of integration with existing applications. Both
  new and existing Fedora users will be interested in learning about and experiencing
  Fedora 4 features and functionality first-hand. Attendees will be given pre-configured
  virtual machines that include Fedora 4 bundled with the Solr search application
  and a triplestore that they can install on their laptops and continue using after
  the workshop. These virtual machines will be used to participate in hands-on exercises
  that will give attendees a chance to experience Fedora 4 by following step-by-step
  instructions. Participants will learn how to create and manage content in Fedora
  4 in accordance with linked data best practices. Finally, participants will learn
  how to search and run SPARQL queries against content in Fedora using the included
  Solr index and triplestore.
