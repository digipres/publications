abstract: 'Stakeholders in scholarly research are paying increased attention to stewardship
  of digital research data1 for the purposes of advancing scientific discovery, driving
  innovation, and promoting trust in science and scholarship. However, little is known
  about the total amounts, characteristics, and sustainability of data that could
  be used for these purposes. The Stewardship Gap is an 18-month project funded by
  the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to understand issues in defining metrics for and
  measuring the stewardship gap: the potential gap between the amount of valuable
  data produced through sponsored projects in the United States and the amount that
  is effectively stewarded and made accessible. This paper reports on the first phase
  of the project, which sought to develop an instrument to gather information about
  research data sustainability from a broad variety of researchers and research disciplines
  and make progress toward the ultimate goals of 1) shedding light on the size, characteristics,
  and sustainability of valuable sponsored research data and creative work in the
  United States, and 2) recommending actions stakeholders can take to address the
  stewardship gap if one is found to exist.'
