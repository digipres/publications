abstract: This paper describes a workshop for the novel, open source web archiving
  tool Webrecorder. Until now, web archiving has mainly been thought to be synonymous
  with “spidering” or “crawling,” meaning that a very basic, simulated version of
  a web browser travels paths of links and storing what it encounters, based on a
  certain set of rules. Webrecorder introduces a new web archiving concept, symmetrical
  archiving, which makes use of actual browsers and actual user behavior to archive
  the web, as well. The software stack used for accessing or replaying archived material
  is exactly the same as during the capturing process. This allows for unprecedented
  fidelity in web archiving, , enabling the preservation of items embedded complex,
  dynamic web applications, while keeping their whole, interactive context as well
  as any user specific content. This new approach to web archiving requires new ways
  of working within institutions; the proposed workshop serves as an introduction
  to symmetrical archiving, using Webrecorder’s emulation-based browsers, defining
  object boundaries, and transitioning from or augmenting crawler-based archives.
