abstract: 'Based on the example of Friedrich Kittler’s digital papers at the Deutsches
  Literaturarchiv Marbach (DLA), this paper explores digital estates and their challenges
  on different logical levels within the pre-archival analysis, documentation and
  indexing process. As opposed to long-term digital preservation procedures, which
  are set about afterwards when relevant digital objects have already been identified,
  this process starts shortly after physical material (computers, hard drives, disks…)
  is delivered to the archive and has been ingested and safeguarded into volume image
  files. In this situation, it is important to get an overview of the “current state”:
  Which data was delivered (amount, formats, duplicates, versions)? What is the legal
  status of the stored data? Which digital objects are relevant and should be accessible
  for which types of users/researchers etc.? What kind of contextual knowledge needs
  to be preserved for the future? In order to address these questions and to assign
  meaning to both technological and documentation needs, the digital analysis tool
  “Indexer”1 was developed [3]. It combines automated, information retrieval routines
  with human interaction features, thereby completing the necessary toolset for processing
  unstructured digital estates. It turns out however, that intellectual work and deep
  knowledge of the collection context still play an important role and must work hand
  in hand with the new automation efforts.'
