abstract: 'Digital stewardship is the active and long-term management of digital objects
  towards their preservation for and unencumbered access by future generations. Although
  the field is rapidly maturing, it still lacks a comprehensive competency profile
  for practitioners. This is due in part to the relative youth of the field, and to
  the fact that being an effective steward of digital materials requires highly specialized
  training that is best acquired through hands-on work. Given the key role that competency
  profiles play in the design of curricula and job postings, the lack of one hinders
  the training and education of professionals for these positions. This paper provides
  a profile of the skills, responsibilities, and knowledge areas that define competency
  in digital stewardship, based on a close study of the projects undertaken in the
  National Digital Stewardship Residency program (NDSR). The authors use a triangulated
  research methodology in order to define the scope of the profile, qualitatively
  analyze the competencies articulated among NDSR project descriptions, and quantitatively
  evaluate those competenciesâ€™ importance to professional success. The profile that
  results from this research has implications for current and future digital stewards:
  training designed with this profile as its basis will focus on the skills most needed
  to be an effective digital steward, and therefore can guide both graduate and professional
  development curricula alike.'
