abstract: This workshop will consider the outcomes of the next RDA ADMP IG workshop
  (cf. [2]) to discuss additional ADMP related topics and will address further open
  research questions around ADMPs, with a special focus on continuous adoption of
  DMPs and automation support. Hence, the aim of this workshop is to identify on base
  of the submitted contributions and the conclusion of the discussion during the workshop
  the recent obstacles that prevent the realization of ADMPs and how those could be
  addressed. The outcome of this workshop will be the preparation of a roadmap towards
  a reference framework of ADMP management and automation.
