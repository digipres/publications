abstract: In this paper we describe new methods for the acquisition of emails from
  a broad range of people and organisations not directly connected with the organization
  responsible for the acquisition. Existing methods for acquisition of emails are
  based either on having easy access to an institution’s email server, or a labour
  intensive process of transferring the emails from donors’ email clients, involving
  for example visits to the individual donors. Furthermore, we describe how different
  representations of the acquisitioned emails are ingested into our repository. The
  use of different representations makes it possible for us to perform a fine grained
  file characterisation, thereby facilitating the level of preservation watch we want
  in connection with the preservation of the acquisitioned emails.
