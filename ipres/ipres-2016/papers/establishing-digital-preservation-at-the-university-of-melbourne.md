abstract: 'Through 2015-2016, the University of Melbourne is set to achieve the Establishment
  phase goals for the implementation of digital preservation processes. These goals
  are detailed in comprehensive Roadmaps, which in turn were developed from the University’s
  Digital Preservation Strategy 2015-2025 [1]. While the Strategy requires implementation
  across four interrelated areas of digital product, two areas have been prioritized:
  Research Outputs and Research Data and Records. The phased Roadmaps have been developed
  to address the challenges inherent to both of these areas. The Roadmaps are comprehensive
  across organization, culture, policy, and infrastructure, to ensure that the University
  of Melbourne addresses the challenge of digital preservation of assets through an
  ongoing commitment to capability building, training, knowledge exchange, advocacy,
  and ongoing investment in infrastructure (both people and technology). Realizing
  this vision will support the University’s functions, accountability, and legacy.'
