abstract: While sophisticated research infrastructures assist scientists in managing
  massive volumes of data, the so-called long tail of research data frequently suffers
  from a lack of such services. This is mostly due to the complexity caused by the
  variety of data to be managed and a lack of easily standardiseable procedures in
  highly diverse research settings. Yet, as even domains in this long tail of research
  data are increasingly data-driven, scientists need efficient means to precisely
  communicate, which version and subset of data was used in a particular study to
  enable reproducibility and comparability of result and foster data re-use. This
  paper presents three implementations of systems supporting such data identification
  services for comma separated value (CSV) files, a dominant format for data exchange
  in these settings. The implementations are based on the recommendations of the Working
  Group on Dynamic Data Citation of the Research Data Alliance (RDA). They provide
  implicit change tracking of all data modifications, while precise subsets are identified
  via the respective subsetting process. These enhances reproducibility of experiments
  and allows efficient sharing of specific subsets of data even in highly dynamic
  data settings.
