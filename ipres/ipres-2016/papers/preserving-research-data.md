abstract: Applying digital preservation actions to research data is a practical step
  in carrying out research data management to its fullest extent and helps ensure
  this data remains usable in the future. This paper considers how repositories holding
  research data can link to an external third party tool, Archivematica, in order
  to carry out preservation actions as part of the data deposit workflow into the
  repository. We present experience from local use of Archivematica at the Universities
  of York and Hull in the Jisc Research Data Spring project “Filling the Digital Preservation
  Gap” as well as Archivematica as a shared service by Arkivum. A main focus across
  these use cases is a practical approach – parsimonious preservation – by using the
  Archivematica tools as they exist now whilst building a foundation for more comprehensive
  preservation strategies in the future. A key area of ongoing investigation covered
  by this presentation is dealing the with long tail of research data file formats,
  in particular how to best manage formats that are not immediately supported and
  need to be added to file registries such as PRONOM.
