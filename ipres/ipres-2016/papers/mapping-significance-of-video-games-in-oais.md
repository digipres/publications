abstract: In this paper, I explore the concept of significant properties and how such
  properties do and do not fit within the Open Archival Information System (OAIS)
  Reference Model. Combining interview data from research about the deployment of
  OAIS in cultural heritage institutions with data about video game production and
  preservation from the Preserving Virtual Worlds II (PVWII) grant project, this paper
  maps stakeholder-identified significant properties onto the 2012 version of OAIS
  [4]. Significant properties have many definitions and even many names. Operationalizing
  this term broadly, many such properties do fit within existing OAIS entities. However,
  significant properties that are relational and external to digital objectsâ€™ code
  and environments do not. This paper concludes that additional metrics are needed
  to begin shaping the process of documenting significant properties at scale.
