abstract: Email provides a rich history of an organization yet poses unique challenges
  to archivists. It is difficult to acquire and process, due to sensitive contents
  and diverse topics and formats, which inhibits access and research. We plan to leverage
  predictive coding used by the legal community to identify and prioritize sensitive
  content for review and redaction while generating descriptive metadata of themes
  and trends. This will empower records creators, archivists, and researchers to better
  understand, synthesize, protect, and preserve email collections. Early findings
  and information on collaborative efforts are shared.
