abstract: This workshop will address the topic of sustained access to digital content
  by providing a legal framework and a technical platform for hosting and distributing
  functional legacy software. Both aspects represent key areas of the UNESCO PERSIST1
  [12] Programme that will focus on the preservation of the digital heritage under
  the UNESCO Memory of the World Programme. The objective of the workshop is to engage
  Digital Preservation Practitioners, Memory Organizations, the ICT industry and policy
  makers in the discussion of (1) use cases for the international platforms of legacy
  software services, e.g., applications to preserving increasingly complex digital
  objects, (2) engagement models among the stakeholders that would lead to revenue
  streams and economically sustainable services, and (3) legal frameworks that ensure
  flexible use of legacy software in the far future, e.g., policies to guide life-cycle
  management of critical software and ‘fair use of software’ beyond its market lifespan.
  The workshop fits most naturally into the innovative practices in digital preservation
  strand due to its pragmatic approach, but will also cover some research into digital
  preservation given the novel nature of the topic.
