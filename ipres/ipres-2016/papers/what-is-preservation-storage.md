abstract: Storage is arguably the most fundamental building block of any technical
  infrastructure designed to preserve digital content. All institutions responsible
  for preserving digital content must use storage systems or services, whether they
  are maintaining their own, sharing infrastructure with other institutions, or relying
  on a third party to provide this service. There are many decisions to be made as
  to what constitutes a storage infrastructure good enough to protect the integrity
  and viability of the content, at a cost affordable to the institution. To date each
  institution has had to independently make these decisions without guidance from
  the digital preservation community. This workshop will explore whether or not it
  is possible for the attendees to write a brief “principles of preservation storage”
  as a starting point for a larger discussion within the community after the conference.
