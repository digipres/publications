abstract: 'This paper outlines some of the most relevant copyright obstacles libraries
  in the cultural heritage institutions sector currently face, when trying to fulfill
  their mission in the digital context. For each of the four main activities – collecting,
  cataloguing, making available and preservation – the essential copyright issues
  will be outlined against the background of the legal situation in Switzerland. Where
  possible, short references to a broader copyright context and the laws of other
  countries will be given. Particular emphasis will be placed on cataloguing and making
  available documents as the current ongoing Swiss copyright revision contains some
  innovative approaches: a catalogue privilege as well as new regulations for the
  handling of orphan works and mass digitization. Concerning collecting and preserving,
  at least some relevant questions in relation to copyright will be posed in order
  to maybe launch further discussions.'
