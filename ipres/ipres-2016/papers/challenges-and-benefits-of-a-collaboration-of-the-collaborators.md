abstract: 'In this panel we want to report about the challenges and

  benefits that we experience in our collaborative efforts. We will

  encourage the audience to add their experiences with initiatives

  like ours. We will furthermore ask input from the audience,

  what issues should we prioritize? From which activities does

  the community profit the most? Should we focus on practical

  solutions or on policy making (or on both)? NCDD, DPC,

  NDSA, Nestor, OPF and PrestoCentre all have their own

  communities, programs, ideas and communications which form

  the basis for their activities. These could be expanded to a

  “collaboration of the collaborators”. The panel will present

  some ideas for such a collaboration and it will invite the

  preservation community to bring in ideas and issues for next

  steps in international collaboration.'
