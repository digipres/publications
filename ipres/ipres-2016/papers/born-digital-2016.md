abstract: 'This poster describes the development and delivery of a weeklong national
  media and communications campaign by the National and State Libraries of Australasia
  (NSLA) Digital Preservation Group to broaden public awareness of what digital preservation
  is and why it matters. Entitled Born Digital 2016: collecting for the future, this
  campaign will be linked with the 25th anniversary of the launch of the World Wide
  Web (6 August 2016) to gain maximum media exposure. The campaign focuses on the
  often unexpected benefits to the wider community of collecting and preserving digital
  material, rather than on the concept of loss which so often underpins arguments
  about why digital preservation is important.'
