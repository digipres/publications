abstract: Science and its data management are in transition. And while the research
  data environment has become heterogeneous and the data dynamic, funding agencies
  and policy makers push towards findable, accessible, interoperable and reuseable
  (= FAIR) research data [1]. A popular issue of the management of data originating
  from (collaborating) research infrastructures is their dynamic nature in terms of
  growth, access rights and quality. On a global scale, systems for access and preservation
  are in place for the big data domains (e.g. environmental sciences, space, climate).
  However, the stewardship for disciplines of the so-called long tail of science remains
  uncertain. This poster gives the impression of an interdisciplinary infrastructure
  facilitating research data archival and publication.
