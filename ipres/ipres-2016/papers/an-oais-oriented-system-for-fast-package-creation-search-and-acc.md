abstract: This paper describes the scalable e-archiving repository system developed
  in the context of the E-ARK project. The system is built using a stack of widely
  used technologies that are known from areas such as search engine development, information
  retrieval and data-intensive computing, enabling efficient storage and processing
  of large volumes of data. The E-ARK Integrated Platform Reference Implementation
  Prototype takes advantage of these technologies and implements an OAIS-oriented
  repository system for creating, archiving, and accessing data as information packages.
  The system consists of software components including an efficient file handling
  infrastructure, a configurable and scalable ingest system, a powerful full-text-based
  search server, and a distributed repository providing file-level random access.
  This paper gives an overview of the architecture and technical components that have
  been used to build the prototype. Furthermore, the paper provides experimental results
  and gives directions for future work.
