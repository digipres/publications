abstract: This paper seeks to advance digital preservation theory and practice by
  presenting an evidence-based model for identifying barriers to digital content rendering
  within a bit-level preservation repository. It details the results of an experiment
  at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign library, where the authors procured
  a random sample of files from their institution’s digital preservation repository
  and tested their ability to open said files using software specified in local policies.
  This sampling regime furnished a preliminary portrait of local file rendering challenges,
  and thus preservation risk, grounded not in nominal preferences for one format’s
  characteristics over another, but in empirical evidence of what types of files present
  genuine barriers to staff and patron access. This research produced meaningful diagnostic
  data to inform file format policymaking for the repository.
