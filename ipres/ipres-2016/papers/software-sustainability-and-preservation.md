abstract: Digital content and data require software for interpretation, processing,
  and use. This requirement raises the issue of sustaining software functionality
  beyond its prime use, when it is fully supported and maintained. Virtualization
  and emulation are two techniques that can encapsulate software in its functional
  form; furthermore, emulation has recently gained traction as a viable option for
  long-term access to digital objects. At the same time, archivists, librarians, and
  museum curators have begun concerted efforts to preserve software that is essential
  for accessing the digital heritage. In this context the members of the panel will
  discuss relevant work that they have been involved in to address the goal of software
  sustainability and preservation.
