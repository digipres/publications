abstract: In this poster, we describe a work package of the project Ellipse - archiving
  of official geospatial data under federal legislation in Switzerland. The work package
  treats the Conservation and Archiving Planning for all the geospatial data of the
  federal administration. The Conservation and Archiving Planning allows to determine
  how long a set of geospatial data is kept at the authority responsible and if it
  is of archival value or not. An overarching, coordinated and joint planning is of
  fundamental importance when dealing with geospatial data sets, so to ensure the
  combinability in the long term.
