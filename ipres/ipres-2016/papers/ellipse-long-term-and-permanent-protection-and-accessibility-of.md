abstract: 'Archiving of geodata historically focused on methods of keeping digital
  geodata alive “almost forever”. Project Ellipse is a joint effort by the Swiss Federal
  Archives (SFA) and the Federal Office of Topography (swisstopo) running from 2011
  to 2016. Its aim is to find a common solution for the archiving of geodata in order
  to implement the applicable legislation. Ellipse follows the entire archiving process
  chain: from the inventory and appraisal of geodata, to its submission to the digital
  archives and finally to the users, who expect geodata in a form that is authentic
  and accessible in a future technological environment. Archiving of geodata is a
  complex task that demands intensive cooperation among all stakeholders. Despite
  our efforts, not all questions have been solved successfully. In this paper, we
  will report our findings and solutions as well as the obstacles we encountered during
  the course of Project Ellipse.'
