abstract: The open, independent, and international standards organization Internet
  Engineering Task Force (IETF) has chartered a working group. It is named "Codec
  Encoding for LossLess Archiving and Realtime transmission" (CELLAR) and aims to
  develop specifications for a lossless audiovisual file format for use in archival
  environments and transmission. It consists of the combination of the audiovisual
  container Matroska, lossless video codec FFV1, and lossless audio codec FLAC. This
  paper reviews the status of this on-going development and thereby provides an overview
  of the challenges and intricacies of audiovisual specification development.
