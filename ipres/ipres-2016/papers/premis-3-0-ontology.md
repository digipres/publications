abstract: The PREMIS 3.0 Ontology Working Group is a community interested in using
  Semantic Web Technology to leverage systems managing the long-term preservation
  of digital archives.  The version 3 of the PREMIS Data Dictionary has stimulated
  the community to revise the current PREMIS OWL Ontology. The revision process aims
  not only to integrate the conceptual model with the changes defined by the new data
  model of the PREMIS version 3.0, but also to ease the implementation of Semantic
  Web Technology in the digital preservation community.
