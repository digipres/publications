abstract: Many cultural heritage institutions with digital collections have performed
  assessments of file formats to inform decision making for a wide range of activities.
  The development of digitization standards and transfer requirements for depositors,
  the selection of storage and access platforms, and preservation planning and the
  decisions to use emulation or migration as a preservation approach all benefit from
  the assessment of file formats for their appropriateness in these different contexts.
  This workshop will bring together several institutions who have created format assessments,
  together with institutions who already are or could potentially reuse this work
  to inform their own institutional policies and preservation planning. The workshop
  will start with short presentations to expose the assessment work that has been
  done, followed by a discussion of how they are being used, or could be used, and
  possibilities for more effectively sharing these resources across institutions for
  the benefit of the digital preservation community.
