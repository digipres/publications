abstract: 'This 3-hour workshop focuses on presenting the current stateof-the-art
  relational database preservation standards and tools used by major national archives
  and other institutions. It presents SIARD 2, a new preservation format for relational
  databases. It also presents the current tools for harvesting information from live
  database management systems 1 into SIARD format and back, namely SIARD Suite2 and
  the Database Preservation Toolkit3. Furthermore, two tools to access and view the
  information preserved in SIARD-les are presented: the E-ARK database viewer4 and
  SIARDexcerpt5. The workshop includes live demonstration of the tools and prompts
  the participants to use them on their own laptops using the demonstration databases
  provided. This workshop closely relates to a tutorial on relational database preservation
  guidelines and use cases, that focuses on the operational concerns of database preservation
  and relevant real-world use cases.'
