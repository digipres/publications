abstract: 'Phaidra (Permanent Hosting, Archiving and Indexing of

  Digital Resources and Assets ) is used as a long-term preservation

  system through the assignment of persistent identifiers

  (permanent links). The project was launched in

  2006 and is the successful result of cooperation between

  the Vienna University Computer Center, the Center for

  Teaching and Learning and the Vienna University Library.

  At present, Phaidra contains about 60,000 objects, all of

  which are provided with structured metadata.'
