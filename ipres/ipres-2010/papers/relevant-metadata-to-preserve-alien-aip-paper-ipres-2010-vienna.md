abstract: 'This article describes the development of Archives

  Ready To Archival Information Packages (AIP)

  Transmission a PREMIS Based Project (ARTAT).

  Following the project approach, the starting phase

  consisted of prototyping a layer conveying preservation

  metadata, which can be encoded from the existing

  archival systems, and exchanged with other repositories.

  This layer called Preservation Metadata Layer (PML)

  uses PREMIS semantics as the common language to

  overcome archival systems differences, and to transmit

  out of its original context, relevant preservation

  information about content objects comprising an AIP.

  Since a repository, following the OAIS reference model,

  usually provides resources with metadata container

  objects, the experiment performed an analysis on

  commonly used container formats, in order to enable the

  traceability of semantics from a local to extra-local

  level, and the technological understandability of alien

  AIPs. The analysis has allowed the definition of a PML

  data model, laying the production of prototypes. The

  adoption of common semantics, like PREMIS, supports

  the opportunity of preserving correctly alien AIPs,

  coming from different technological environments, and

  hopefully enables the overcoming of obstacles to the

  interoperability among diverse archival systems.'
