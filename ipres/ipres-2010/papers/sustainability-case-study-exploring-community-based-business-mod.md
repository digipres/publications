abstract: arXiv.org is internationally acknowledged as a pioneering and successful
  open access digital archive for research articles. The case study discusses the
  efforts to establish a community-based sustainability strategy to ensure the longevity,
  effectiveness, and success of the service. It also describes the costs associated
  with running the repository that take into consideration both daily operational
  costs and efforts in improving its technical architecture and functionality.
