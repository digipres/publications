abstract: 'Digital curation micro-services offer a light-weight

  alternative to preservation systems that are developed

  on digital repository and framework technology stacks.

  These are often too complex for small and medium-sized

  memory institutions to deploy and maintain. The

  Archivematica project has implemented a micro-services

  approach to develop an integrated suite of free and

  open-source tools that allows users to process digital

  objects from ingest to access while applying format

  specific preservation policies. Inspired by a call to

  action in a recent UNESCO Memory of the World

  report, the goal of the Archivematica project is to reduce

  the cost and technical complexity of deploying a

  comprehensive, interoperable digital curation solution

  that is compliant with standards and best practices.'
