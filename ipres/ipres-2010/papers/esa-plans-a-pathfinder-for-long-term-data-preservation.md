abstract: 'Digital preservation is difficult. The technical difficulties

  are the cause of much research. Other types of difficulty are

  those to do with organisational commitment, funding and

  context.

  With the increasing interest on global change monitoring,

  also the use and exploitation of long time series of Earth

  Observation (EO) data has been increasing systematically,

  calling for a need to preserve the EO data without time

  constrains.

  On the other hand:

  · Data archiving and preservation strategies are still

  mostly limited to the satellite lifetime and few years

  after.

  · The data volumes are increasing dramatically.

  · Archiving and data access technology are evolving

  rapidly.

  · EO data archiving strategies, if existing at all, are

  different for each EO mission, each operator or

  agency.

  In the meantime the issue grows more urgent since more

  and more EO missions’ data can be called ‘historic’ and more

  and more operators are faced with the decision of whether

  and how to preserve their data.

  This paper describes the European Space Agency’s (ESA)

  plans for long term commitment to preserving EO data

  concerning Europe. We believe this shows that ESA provides

  a pathfinder example of the way in which all these difficulties

  can be tackled.'
