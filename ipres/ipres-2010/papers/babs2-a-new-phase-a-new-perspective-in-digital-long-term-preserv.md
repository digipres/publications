abstract: 'BABS is an acronym for Library Archiving and Access System (Bibliothekarisches
  Archivierungs- und Bereitstellungssystem), which constitutes the infrastructure
  for digital long-term preservation at the Bavarian State Library (BSB). During the
  two-year project BABS2 funded by German Research Association (DFG) BSB focuses together
  with the Leibniz-Supercomputing Centre (LRZ) on advancing its organizational and
  technical processes under the aspect of trustworthiness according to the nestor
  criteria catalogue. Important achievements are e.g. framing an institutional policy
  for digital preservation including local, regional, national tasks of a large-scale
  research and archive library, conducting and evaluating a survey concerning the
  archiving requirements of all BSB departments, documenting the ongoing archiving
  processes, introducing an appropriate quality management and improving the scalability
  of the preservation system. Additionally BSB participate in different national and
  international committees.

  This experience report sheds light on the various organizational and technical aspects
  which have to be taken into consideration when enhancing an existing infrastructure
  for digital long-term preservation.'
