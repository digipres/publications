abstract: 'An accepted digital preservation workflow is emerging in

  which file formats are identified and those believed to be

  at risk are migrated to what are perceived to be less risky

  formats. This raises important questions about what to

  convert and when, if at all. In other words, how to connect

  file identification and migration. This area has become

  known as preservation planning, and seeks to take

  account of a wide variety of factors that might impact

  preservation decisions. Broadly there are two approaches

  to preservation planning. One provided in some digital

  preservation systems is to simplify and reduce both the

  number of file formats stored and therefore limit the number

  of preservation tools needed based on accepted recommendations.

  A more thorough, flexible and possibly

  complex approach, supported by the Plato preservation

  planning tool developed by the Planets project, allows decisions

  on preservation actions to combine analysis of the

  characteristics of different file formats with specific local

  requirements, such as costs and resources. This paper

  shows how Plato can be integrated with digital repository

  software, in this case EPrints, to enable this powerful approach

  to be used effectively to manage content in repositories

  of different sizes and with varying degrees of preservation

  expertise and support. These tools are accessed via

  a common repository interface to enable repository managers,

  and others who do not specialise in preservation, to

  moderate decisions on preservation planning and to control

  preservation actions.'
