abstract: This article describes a methodology which supports evaluation of bit preservation
  strategies for different digital materials. This includes evaluation of alternative
  bit preservation solutions. The methodology presented uses the preservation planning
  tool Plato for evaluations, and a BR-ReMS prototype to calculate measures for how
  well bit preservation requirements are met. Planning storage of different types
  of data as part of preservation planning involves classification of the data with
  regard to requirements on confidentiality, bit safety, availability and costs. Selection
  of storage parameters is quite complex since e.g. more copies of data means better
  bit safety, but higher cost and higher risk of compromising confidentiality. Based
  on a case study of a bit repository offering differentiated bit preservation solutions,
  the article will present results of using the methodology to make plans and choices
  of alternatives for different digital material with different requirements for bit
  integrity and confidentiality. This study shows that the methodology, including
  the tools used, is suitable for this purpose.
