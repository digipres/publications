abstract: 'Predicting the costs of long-term digital preservation is a

  crucial yet complex task for even the largest repositories

  and institutions. For smaller projects and individual

  researchers faced with preservation requirements, the

  problem is even more overwhelming, as they lack the

  accumulated experience of the former. Yet being able to

  estimate future preservation costs is vital to answering a

  range of important questions for each. The LIFE (Life

  Cycle Information for E-Literature) project, which has

  just completed its third phase, helps institutions and

  researchers address these concerns, reducing the

  financial and preservation risks, and allowing decision

  makers to assess a range of options in order to achieve

  effective preservation while operating within financial

  restraints. The project is a collaboration between

  University College London (UCL), The British Library

  and the Humanities Advanced Technology and

  Information Institute (HATII) at the University of

  Glasgow. Funding has been supplied in the UK by the

  Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) and the

  Research Information Network (RIN).'
