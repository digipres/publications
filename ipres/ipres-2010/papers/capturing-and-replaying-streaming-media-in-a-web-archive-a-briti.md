abstract: 'A prerequisite for digital preservation is to be able to capture

  and retain the content which is considered worth preserving.

  This has been a significant challenge for web archiving,

  especially for websites with embedded streaming media

  content, which cannot be copied via a simple HTTP request to

  a URL. This paper describes the approach taken by the British

  Library in capturing and replaying streaming media in a web

  archive. A working system is now in place which will lead to

  the development of more generic tools and workflows,

  contributing to addressing a common challenge for the web

  archiving community. The British Library recently archived a

  large scale public arts project website,

  http://www.oneandother.co.uk, which contains 2,400 hours of

  flash videos, streamed over Real Time Messaging Protocol

  (RTMP). The case study also presents an overview of the nontechnical

  issues relevant to archiving this high-profile website.'
