abstract: 'After four years of research within the PLANETS project

  and two years of KEEP the jigsaw puzzle of emulation becomes

  a more complete picture. Emulation strategies are

  now seen as a viable complement to migration. A conceptual

  and theoretical groundwork has already been laid

  out, e.g. proper definition and selection of suitable emulators.

  However, integration into preservation frameworks

  and additional software archiving remain open research

  questions. This paper discusses several aspects of reliable

  integration and proposes development steps for a more

  complete emulation-based strategies in long-term preservation.'
