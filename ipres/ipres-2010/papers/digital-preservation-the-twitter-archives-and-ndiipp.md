abstract: On April 14, 2010, the Library of Congress and Twitter made the joint announcement
  that the Library would receive a gift of the archive of all public tweets shared
  through the service since its inception in 2006. The media and community response
  was tremendous, raising many questions about how the Library would be stewarding
  and providing access to the collection. There are many issues to consider, from
  the technical mechanisms of transfer to the Library and the ongoing updates to the
  archive, to curatorial policies, to planning for a new type of research access to
  a Library collection. The Twitter archive joins a number of born-digital collections
  at the Library. This year the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation
  Program (NDIIPP) celebrates a decade of digital preservation actions and discovery,
  working with a network of over 170 partners resulting in over 200 terabytes of all
  types of important digital content. Collectively, we have built lasting relationships,
  helped facilitate natural networks within the overall NDIIPP network, and tested
  new tools and services that support the work of the partners in the network. We
  will rely on the collective wisdom of our partners as we grapple with the challenges
  of curating and serving a digital collection as rich and diverse as the Twitter
  archive.
