abstract: Repository platforms offer significant tools aiding institutions to preserve
  the wealth of their information resources. This paper presents the data model as
  well as the architectural features of Mopseus, a digital library service, built
  on top of Fedora-commons middleware, designed to facilitate institutions to develop
  and preserve their own repositories. The main advantage of Mopseus is that it minimizes
  the customization and programming effort that Fedora-commons involves. Moreover
  it provides an added value service which semantically annotates the internal structure
  of a Digital Object. The paper focuses on the preservation functionalities of Mopseus
  and presents a mechanism for automated generation of PREMIS metadata for each Digital
  Object of the repository. This mechanism is activated whenever an object is modified
  and is based on a mapping of the Mopseus data model to the PREMIS data model that
  ensures the validity of the transformation of the information stored in a Mopseus
  repository to semantically equivalent PREMIS metadata.
