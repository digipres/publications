abstract: 'Institutions that perform web crawls in order to gather

  heritage collections have millions – or even billions – of

  files encoded in thousands of different formats about

  which they barely know anything. Many of these

  heritage institutions are members of the International

  Internet Preservation Consortium, whose Preservation

  Working Group decided to address the issues related to

  format identification in web archive.

  Its first goal is to design an overview of the formats to

  be found in different types of collections (large-, smallscale…)

  over time. It shows that the web seems to be

  becoming a more standardized space. A small number

  of formats – frequently open – cover from 90 to 95% of

  web archive collections, and we can reasonably hope to

  find preservation strategies for them.

  However, this survey is mainly built on a source – the

  MIME type of the file sent in the server response – that

  gives good statistical trends but is not fully reliable for

  every file. This is the reason why it appears necessary to

  study how to use, for web archives, identification tools

  developed for other kinds of digital assets.'
