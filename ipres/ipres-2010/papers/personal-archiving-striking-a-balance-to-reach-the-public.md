abstract: 'Never have so many people documented so much about

  their lives. Digital technology has empowered

  individuals to build large, rich collections of

  photographs, videos, e-mail, documents and other

  information. But the ability to create digital content is

  far outstripping personal capacity to manage and keep it

  over time. Looking ahead over the next decade, it is

  possible to foresee two consequences for libraries and

  archives. The most obvious and certain is that digital

  accessions of personal materials will supplement, and

  eventually surpass, traditional analog materials. Another

  outcome is more subtle and speculative: people seeking

  trusted guidance about how best to manage their

  important digital items. Memory organizations are

  reasonable places for people to go in search of such

  guidance, and this presents an opportunity to provide a

  valuable—and highly visible—public service. The

  Library of Congress National Digital Information

  Infrastructure and Preservation Program is undertaking a

  project to provide guidance aimed at the general public

  in connection with personal digital archiving. The

  project focuses on interacting with people through

  several different channels, including web-based written

  instructions, video productions, and social media. The

  Library is also exploring use of public events such as

  “Personal Archiving Day” to engage directly with

  people. In developing a strategy for this program, the

  Library has to balance professional practice with the

  need to clearly communicate with non-specialists in a

  Web 2.0 environment.'
