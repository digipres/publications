abstract: 'Early adopters of blogs will have made use of

  externally-hosted blog platforms, such as

  Wordpress.com and Blogger.com, due, perhaps, to the

  lack of a blogging infrastructure within the institution or

  concerns regarding restrictive terms and conditions

  covering use of such services. There will be cases in

  which such blogs are now well-established and contain

  useful information not only for current readership but

  also as a resource which may be valuable for future

  generations.

  The need to preserve content which is held on such

  third-party services (“the Cloud’) provides a set of new

  challenges which are likely to be distinct from the

  management of content hosted within the institution, for

  which institutional policies should address issues such

  as ownership and scope of content. Such challenges

  include technical issues, such as the approaches used to

  gather the content and the formats to be used and policy

  issues related to ownership, scope and legal issues.

  This paper describes the approaches taken in

  UKOLN, an applied research department based at the

  University of Bath, to the preservation of blogs used in

  the organisation. The paper covers the technical

  approaches and policy issues associated with the

  curation of blogs a number of different types of blogs:

  blogs used by members of staff in the department; blogs

  used to support project activities and blogs used to

  support events.'
