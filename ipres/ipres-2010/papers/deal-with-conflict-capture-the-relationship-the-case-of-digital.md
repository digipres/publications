abstract: 'Properties of digital objects play a central role in digital

  preservation. All key preservation services are linked via

  a common understanding of the properties which describe

  the digital objects in a repository''s care. Unfortunately,

  different services deal with properties on

  sometimes different levels of description. While, for example,

  a preservation characterization service may extract

  the fontSize of a string, the preservation planning

  service may require the preservation of the text’s formatting.

  Additionally, a value for the same property may be

  obtained in various ways, sometimes resulting in different

  observed values. Furthermore, properties are not always

  equally applicable across different file formats.

  This report investigates where in these three situations

  relationships between properties need to be defined

  to overcome possible misalignments.

  The analysis was based on observations gained during

  a case study of the nature of the properties that are captured

  in different institutions’ preservation requirements

  and those of use in Planets preservation services.'
