abstract: The digital revolution has completely changed how audiences use and interact
  with audiovisual media. The National Film Board of Canada (NFB) has been preparing
  for this inevitable revolution for several years now, developing partnerships and
  carrying out research on image and sound processing, innovative transfer techniques,
  accessibility and distribution to facilitate the transition to digital technology.
  In recent years, the technical and operational infrastructure has undergone significant
  upheavals. And the NFB has taken up the gauntlet. The new digital reality is much
  more sophisticated than past technologies, but also much more open and promising.
  Our aim is to exploit the full potential of these new and constantly evolving technologies.
