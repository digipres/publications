abstract: 'Being a private international enterprise, the ongoing transition from paper
  to digitally stored documents and records has created some new challenges.

  By implementing an Electronic Records Management (ERM) system, the tool for conducting
  records management is in place, but in order to utilise the possibilities, a revision
  of the retention and disposition schedule was necessary.

  The task of developing a new schedule is time-consuming, but it will be an important
  tool for future RM work. It gives a good overview of the content of the archives.
  When implemented it will reduce growth, improve sharing of information and ensure
  compliance over time. It is also a vital tool for long term planning, in knowing
  what to keep and for how long, strategies can be developed based on timeframe, cost,
  need for access and volume. It can also be used in discussions towards historical
  institutions for the transferee of some or all historic records.

  This paper describes the tasks involved in the process towards a new schedule.'
