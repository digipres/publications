abstract: 'This paper outlines the recent initiative run at CINES,

  a national IT datacentre for French academic

  researchers, to formalize the business processes of its

  department dedicated to the long-term preservation of

  digital objects, which is at present one of the very few

  operational long-term preservation platforms in France

  for the public sector and Higher Education and Research

  in particular.

  One of the strategic goals of this organization is the

  evaluation and assessment of service quality. The

  processes formalization activity – coupled with an

  external audit and an ITIL approach – highlighted the

  department good practices, gaps and weaknesses.

  The processes global map and most of the twenty

  detailed process maps have been put together to support

  the team in its documentation goal and are available

  online on the institutional web site, along with the

  CINES specific rules for archival processes

  formalization based on standards such as ISO 9001 or

  ISO 14721.

  This experiment has revealed that such a process

  approach can to be an excellent mean to structure and

  plan for an efficient implementation of the preservation

  strategy as well as an opportunity to improve service

  quality, which is actually the final objective of the digital

  long-term repository of the centre since it’s aiming at the

  future ISO 16363 certification.'
