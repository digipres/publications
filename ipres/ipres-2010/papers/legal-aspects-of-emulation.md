abstract: Apart from technical, organisational and economical challenges of long-term
  access to digital objects, legal implications arise as well. The KEEP project, co-funded
  by the European Commission under the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), researched
  the legal aspects of emulation as part of their research to create a preservation
  strategy based on emulation. It addresses the legal implications in France, Germany
  and The Netherlands as well as on European level. Insights have been gained into
  the legality of transferring content from old media carriers to newer ones and the
  reproduction of hardware into software emulators. This paper presents the results
  of the study, conducted by the Biblioth√®que nationale de France (BnF), Deutsche
  Nationalbibliothek (DNB) and the Koninklijke Bibliotheek (KB, the National Library
  of the Netherlands).
