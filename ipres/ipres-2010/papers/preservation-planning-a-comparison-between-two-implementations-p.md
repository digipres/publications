abstract: 'This paper examines preservation planning as it is

  implemented within the National Library’s preservation

  repository (Rosetta) and compares it directly to the

  PLATO tool created as part of the PLANETS project.

  Preservation planning is both a business precondition

  and the systematic framework defining any preservation

  action. At the National Library of New Zealand Te Puna

  Mātauranga o Aotearoa, preservation planning is

  embedded within the Rosetta system.

  For the Library, the challenge can be stated simply:

  preserve New Zealand’s digital documentary heritage.

  With no limitations or control over the format of the

  content that is collected and preserved, The National

  Library of New Zealand Te Puna Mātauranga o

  Aotearoa (NLNZ) has ‘issues’ to resolve before the

  long-term preservation of digital collections can be

  assured. Solving these and other problems is the

  responsibility of the National Digital Heritage Archive

  and a significant step has been taken through the

  development of the Rosetta preservation repository

  system in conjunction with Ex Libris Group.1'
