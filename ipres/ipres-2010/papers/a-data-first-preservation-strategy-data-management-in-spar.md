abstract: 'The Bibliothèque nationale de France has developed its

  trusted digital repository, SPAR (Scalable Preservation

  and Archiving Repository), as a data-first system. This

  implies having fully described collections, through use

  of metadata standards in the information packages, such

  as METS, PREMIS, MIX or textMD, in a way that will

  make sense given the diversity of our documents.

  The need for full documentation also applies to the

  system itself. On the one hand, SPAR is self-describing

  in order to ensure its durability. On the other hand, all

  the information that is ingested into the system

  contributes to determine its settings and its behavior.

  The Data Management module is at the heart of these

  information flows.

  We expect to push this data-first objective ahead by

  using RDF technology, based on existing and trusted

  information models and ontologies, such as OAIS and

  PREMIS. The challenges and successes we encounter all

  serve the greater goal of having a unique and versatile

  data model for every user of the system, whether

  collection curator or system manager.'
