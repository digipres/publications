abstract: 'In this paper we present a case study and selected results

  from a research on digital preservation amongst digital

  libraries in Europe. We propose a framework for gap

  analysis in digital preservation encompassing the

  diffusion of preservation practices and the life-cycle of

  data. We also present a Gap Analysis Tool that we

  developed to support visual analysis of gaps in the

  implementation of digital preservation amongst

  communities. We discuss selected results from the

  application of the tool in the community of libraries in

  Europe.'
