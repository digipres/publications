abstract: 'This paper outlines the Europe-wide programme of

  outreach and training events, jointly organised by

  HATII at the University of Glasgow and the British

  Library, in collaboration with a number of

  European partner institutions, on behalf of the

  Planets project (Preservation and Long Term

  Access Through Networked Services) between

  June 2009 and April 2010. It describes the

  background to the programme and the events which

  took place during the final year of the project,

  focussing on the success of the events based on

  feedback results, lessons learned from the

  production of the series, and the perceived longterm

  impact of the programme on future Planets

  and digital preservation training activities.'
