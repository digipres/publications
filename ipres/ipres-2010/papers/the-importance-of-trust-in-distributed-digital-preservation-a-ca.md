abstract: 'Distributed digital preservation is a maturing and

  appealing solution to the pressing problem of ensuring

  the survivability of digital content. Like all other digital

  preservation efforts, distributed digital preservation

  solutions must communicate trust to their Designated

  Communities as they continue to mature. The following

  paper discusses the importance of establishing this trust,

  retraces the development of TRAC as a reliable tool for

  evaluating trustworthy repositories, and details the

  process of the MetaArchive Cooperative’s application of

  TRAC to its distributed digital preservation solution.

  This process revealed that the current metrics for

  gauging trust in digital preservation could be readily

  applied to distributed solutions with great effect.

  However, because these metrics often presume a more

  centralized approach to preservation, the process also

  revealed the need to apply them carefully and with great

  thought. To underscore this need, three organizational

  and technical comparisons are made between the

  MetaArchive’s distributed preservation activities and

  the more centralized model assumed by TRAC and the

  OAIS Reference Model. The paper concludes with the

  question as to whether distributed digital preservation

  needs to be better defined within existing models such

  as OAIS or through the creation of a new reference

  model for distributed digital preservation.'
