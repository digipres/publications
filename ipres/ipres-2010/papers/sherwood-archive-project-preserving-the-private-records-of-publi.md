abstract: 'Digital business records are more at risk now than ever

  before. The dynamics of entrepreneurial business, the

  fear of litigation and e-discovery, and the narrowing

  demands of shareholder capitalism compound the

  technological threats to the record of business. The

  Sherwood Archive Project, a project of the Digital

  Archive of the Birth of the Dot Com Era, seeks to

  mitigate the risks to business records by partnering with

  Sherwood Partners, Inc to develop strategies and

  workflows to preserve the records of failed business

  firms.'
