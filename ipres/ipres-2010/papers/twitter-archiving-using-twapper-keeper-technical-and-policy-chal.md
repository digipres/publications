abstract: 'Twitter is widely used in a range of different contexts, ranging from informal
  social communications and marketing purposes through to supporting various professional
  activities in teaching and learning and research. The growth in Twitter use has
  led to a recognition of the need to ensure that Twitter posts (''tweets'') can be
  accessed and reused by a variety of third party applications.

  This paper describes development work to the Twapper Keeper Twitter archiving service
  to support use of Twitter in education and research. The reasons for funding developments
  to an existing commercial service are described and the approaches for addressing
  the sustainability of such developments are provided. The paper reviews the challenges
  this work has addressed including the technical challenges in processing large volumes
  of traffic and the policy issues related, in particular, to ownership and copyright.

  The paper concludes by describing the experiences gained in using the service to
  archive tweets posted during the WWW 2010 conference and summarising plans for further
  use of the service.'
