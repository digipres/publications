abstract: 'Given the growing need for cross-repository integration

  to enable a trusted, scalable, open and distributed

  content infrastructure, this paper introduces the Policy-

  Driven Repository Interoperability (PoDRI) project

  investigating interoperability mechanisms between

  repositories at the policy level. Simply moving digital

  content from one repository to another may not capture

  the essential management policies needed to ensure its

  integrity and authenticity. Platform-independent, policyaware

  object models, including policy expressions, and

  a distributed architecture for policy-driven management

  are fundamental building blocks of a sustainable access

  and preservation infrastructure. This project integrates

  iRODS and Fedora to demonstrate such an

  infrastructure. Using iRODS and its rules engine,

  combined with Fedoraâ€™s rich semantic object model for

  digital objects, provides the basis for implementing a

  policy-driven test-bed. Using a policy-driven

  architecture is an essential part of realizing a fully

  model-driven repository infrastructure capable of

  decoupling the permanent digital content from the

  constantly evolving information technology used to

  support them.'
