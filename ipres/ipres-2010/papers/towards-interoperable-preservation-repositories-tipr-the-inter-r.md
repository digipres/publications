abstract: The TIPR Project (Towards Interoperable Preservation Repositories) runs
  from October 2008 through September 2010. The aim of the project is to develop,
  test, and promote a standard format for exchanging information packages among OAIS-based
  repositories. This paper reviews the use cases for the transfer of information from
  one repository to another, reviews the Repository eXchange Format (RXP) developed
  by TIPR, and discusses the need for additional information not contained in the
  exchange package itself. It looks at two existing specifications, the Producer-Archive
  Interface Methodology and Into the Archive (Wege ins Archiv), in the context of
  inter-repository transfer. Finally it outlines information required in an inter-repository
  service agreement.
