abstract: 'The Planets Testbed, a key outcome of the EC co-funded

  Planets project, is a web based application that provides

  a controlled environment where users can perform experiments

  on a variety of preservation tools using sample data

  and a standardised yet configurable experiment methodology.

  Development of the Testbed required the close

  participation of many geographically and strategically disparate

  organisations throughout the four-year duration of

  the project, and this paper aims to reflect on a number

  of key lessons that were learned whilst developing software

  for digital preservation experimentation. In addition

  to giving an overview of the Testbed and its evolution,

  this paper describes the iterative development process that

  was adopted, presents a set of key challenges faced when

  developing preservation software in a distributed manner,

  and offers a real-world example of how lessons can be

  learned from these challenges.'
