abstract: 'The “paperless office” concept has been around for

  decades, and many have cited that the electronic office

  has instead increased the amount of paper produced.

  Case studies have shown that a successful “paperless”

  system requires motivation, ease of use, and cost savings

  [5]. Paper will co-exist with electronic records for the

  foreseeable future; however, what happens when the

  official record of an institution becomes “paperless”?

  This short paper presents a case study describing the

  efforts in the University of Oregon Office of the

  President to move to a fully electronic records system,

  the trickle-down effect to campus units, and the work of

  the Libraries to preserve the institutional record. The

  Libraries created a model to solve the immediate needs

  of the Office of the President addressing issues of

  workflow and preservation before an ideal system and

  staffing could be realized. A hands-on approach was

  employed, focusing on day-to-day work and ease of use

  for office contacts, and standards and migration plans for

  archival files using PLATTER [1]. By doing this, a

  foundation was created for an electronic records system

  that can be adapted across campus for administrative

  offices, faculty scholarship, cultural museums, science

  labs, and student coursework.'
