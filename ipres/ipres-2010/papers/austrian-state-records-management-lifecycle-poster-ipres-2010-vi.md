abstract: 'The Austrian state is building an integrated “cradle to grave” electronic
  records management and archive process to ensure that electronic records are managed
  correctly throughout their lifetime.

  This has already included the rollout of records management through federal agencies
  via the ELAK (Elektronisher Akt) system and the specification of a format for transfer
  between agencies called EDIAKT. The latter includes transfer to the national archives
  and thus, in essence, the definition of the format of a valid SIP that can be ingested
  into an archival system.

  The Austrian Federal Chancellery is now funding the provision of such a central
  archival system plus a general license allowing all Austrian public bodies to benefit
  from the technology for archiving and preservation. After a competitive tender,
  Siemens IT Solutions & Systems are providing this system utilising the Safety Deposit
  Box (SDB) system from Tessella.

  This system will ingest the SIPs (in EDIAKT format) into long-term storage and provide
  comprehensive access, data management, preservation and administration functions.
  The Österreichische Staatsarchiv (Austrian State Archives) will be the first to
  use this system by the end of 2010.

  This is the basis on which the requirements for maintaining electronic records,
  which will be the sources of historical research in the future, are being created.
  This will preserve the historical heritage of Austria for generations to come.'
