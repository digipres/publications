abstract: 'Data attrition compromises the ability of scientists to validate and reuse
  the data that underlie scientific articles. For this reason, many have called to
  archive data supporting published articles. However, few successful models for the
  sustainability of disciplinary data archives exist and many of these rely heavily
  on ephemeral funding sources.

  The Dryad project is a consortium of bioscience journals that seeks to establish
  a data repository to which authors can submit, upon publication, integral data that
  does not otherwise have a dedicated public archive. This archive is intended to
  be sustained, in part, through the existing economy of scholarly publishing. In
  2009, Dryad commissioned the develop-ment of a cost model and sustainability plan.
  Here we report the outcome of this work to date.

  The sustainability efforts of Dryad are expected to provide a model that may be
  exported to other disciplines, informing the scale needed for a sustainable “small
  science” data repository and showing how to accommodate diverse business practices
  among scholarly publishers, funding agencies and research institutions.'
