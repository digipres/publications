abstract: 'Because of the historical value of email in the late 20th

  and 21st centuries, Harvard University Libraries began

  planning for an email archiving project in early 2007. A

  working group comprised of University archivists,

  curators, records managers, librarians and technologists

  studied the problem and recommended the undertaking

  of a pilot email archiving project at the University

  Library. This two-year pilot would implement a system

  for ingest, processing, preservation, and eventual end

  user delivery of email, in anticipation of it becoming an

  ongoing central service at the University after the pilot.

  This paper describes some of the unexpected challenges

  encountered during the pilot project and how they were

  addressed by design decisions. Key challenges included

  the requirement to design the system so that it could

  handle other types of born digital content in the future,

  and the effect of archiving email with sensitive data to

  Harvardâ€™s preservation repository, the Digital

  Repository Service (DRS).'
