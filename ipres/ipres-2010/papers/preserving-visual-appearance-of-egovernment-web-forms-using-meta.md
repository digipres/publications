abstract: 'This paper summarizes work done in a PhD study on

  metadata driven imitation for preservation of visual

  appearance of web forms and/or receipts used in

  eGovernment services. The research done suggests that

  metadata, and e.g. a background image, can be used to

  describe the visual appearance of documents, and that

  this also facilitates having the data separated from the

  visual appearance. This separation provides the ability

  to present the material to the users in different ways,

  depending on their needs and requirements, while

  retaining the ability to present the object in its original

  look. The original look is seen as the most versatile way

  of presenting the material, giving the most fruitful base

  of interpretation and understanding, but if the users

  where familiar with the material, they liked the ability to

  have the material presented in simplified ways, where

  many of the sometimes "distracting" visual attributes

  where removed. In general, preserving the visual

  appearance and keeping the data separated from the

  form, was seen as useful and beneficial to both the users

  and the preservation professionals. As always in digital

  preservation contexts, documentation of this process

  and the relation between the metadata describing the

  visual appearance'
