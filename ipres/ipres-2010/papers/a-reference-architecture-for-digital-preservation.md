abstract: 'Apart from being a technological issue, digital

  preservation raises several organizational challenges.

  These challenges are starting to be addressed in the

  industrial design and e-Science domains, where

  emerging requirements cannot be addressed directly by

  OAIS. Thus, new approaches to design and assess

  digital preservation environments are required. We

  propose a Reference Architecture as a tool that can

  capture the essence of those emerging preservation

  environments and provide ways of developing and

  deploying preservation-enabled systems in

  organizations. This paper presents the main concepts

  from which a Reference Architecture for digital

  preservation can be built, along with an analysis of the

  environment surrounding a digital preservation system.

  We present a concrete Reference Architecture,

  consisting of a process to derive concrete digital

  preservation architectures, which is supported by an

  architecture framework for organizing architecture

  descriptions. In that way, organizations can be better

  prepared to cope with the present and future challenges

  of digital preservation.'
