abstract: 'More and more information that is considered for digital

  long-term preservation is generated by Web 2.0 applications

  like wikis, blogs or social networking tools. However,

  there is little support for the preservation of these data today.

  Currently they are preserved like regular Web sites

  without taking the flexible, lightweight and mostly graphbased

  data models of the underlying Web 2.0 applications

  into consideration. By this, valuable information about the

  relations within these data and about links to other data is

  lost. Furthermore, information about the internal structure

  of the data, e.g., expressed by wiki markup languages is

  not preserved entirely.

  We argue that this currently neglected information is

  of high value in a long-term preservation strategy of Web

  2.0 data and describe our approach for the preservation

  of wiki contents that is based on Semantic Web technologies.

  In particular we describe the distributed architecture

  of our wiki preservation prototype (Urobe) which implements

  a migration strategy for wiki contents and is based

  on Semantic Web and Linked Data principles. Further,

  we present a first vocabulary for the description of wiki

  core elements derived from a combination of established

  vocabularies/standards from the Semantic Web and digital

  preservation domains, namely Dublin Core, SIOC, VoiD

  and PREMIS.'
