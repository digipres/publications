abstract: 'As mechanisms emerge to certify the trustworthiness of

  digital preservation repositories, no systematic efforts

  have been devoted to assessing the quality and

  usefulness of the preserved content itself. With generous

  support from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the

  University of Michigan’s School of Information, in close

  collaboration with the University of Michigan Library

  and HathiTrust, is developing new methods to measure

  the visual and textual qualities of books from university

  libraries digitized by Google, Internet Archive, and

  others and then deposited for preservation. This paper

  describes a new approach to measuring quality in largescale

  digitization; namely, the absence of error relative

  to the expected uses of the deposited content. The paper

  specifies the design of a research project to develop and

  test statistically valid methods of measuring error. The

  design includes a model of understanding and recording

  errors observed through manual inspection of sample

  volumes, and strategies to validate the outcomes of the

  research through open evaluation by stakeholders and

  users. The research project will utilize content deposited

  in HathiTrust – a large-scale digital preservation

  repository that presently contains over five million

  digitized volumes – to develop broadly applicable

  quality assessment strategies for preservation

  repositories.'
