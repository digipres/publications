abstract: 'The British Library’s web archive comprises several

  terabyte of harvested websites. Like other content streams

  this data should be ingested into the library’s central

  preservation repository. The repository requires a

  standardized Submission- and Archival Information

  Package.

  Harvested Websites are stored in Archival Information

  Packages (AIP). Each AIP is described by a METS file.

  Operational metadata for resource discovery as well as

  archival metadata are normalized and embedded in the

  METS descriptor using common metadata profiles such as

  PREMIS and MODS.

  The British Library’s METS profile for web archiving

  considers dissemination and preservation use cases

  ensuring the authenticity of data. The underlying complex

  content model disaggregates websites into web pages,

  associated objects and their actual digital manifestations.

  The additional abstract layer ensures accessibility over the

  long term and the ability to carry out preservation actions

  such as migrations. The library wide preservation policies

  and principles become applicable to web content as well.'
