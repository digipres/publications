abstract: 'This article explores preservation of digital material in a

  library context with a focus on logical object modelling

  that takes both preservation and dissemination into

  account. The article describes normalisation of data

  expressed via a logical object model. This logical object

  model is designed to support the requirements for joint

  preservation and dissemination. Additionally the article

  includes a suggestion for a possible implementation that

  respects the logical object model.

  Formulation, of the requirements and possible

  implementation for a logical object model, is based on

  observation of current trends, as well as results from a

  research project on preservation strategies for libraries.

  The research project has been carried out at the Royal

  Library of Denmark, and it is based on a case study of a

  10 year old web application containing the Archive of

  Danish Literature. The formulated requirements include

  e.g. requirements for many-to-many migration in

  preservation and requirements for homogenous

  navigation and social networking in dissemination.

  Many of the described observations and results have

  parallels to other types of material. These parallels are

  partly described, and thus the results can be used as a

  contribution to development of systems and strategies

  for preservation and dissemination in the new decade

  and beyond.'
