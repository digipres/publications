abstract: 'HathiTrust is a collaboration of universities working

  together to establish a repository that archives and shares

  their digitized collections. Initially, the Submission

  Information Packages (SIPs) deposited into HathiTrust

  were extremely uniform, being constituted primarily of

  books digitized by Google. HathiTrustâ€™s ingest

  validation processes were correspondingly highly

  regular, designed to ensure that these SIPs met agreedupon

  qualities and specifications. As HathiTrust has

  expanded to include materials digitized from other

  sources, SIPs have become more varied in their content

  and specifications, introducing the need to make

  adjustments to ingest and validation routines. One of the

  primary sources of new SIPs is the Internet Archive,

  which has digitized a large number of public domain

  materials owned by HathiTrust partners.

  Many of the technical, structural, and

  descriptive characteristics of materials digitized by the

  Internet Archive did not match previously developed

  standards for materials in HathiTrust. A variety of

  solutions were developed to transform these materials

  into HathiTrust-compatible AIPs and ingest them into

  the repository. The process of developing these solutions

  provides an example to other organizations that would

  like to add new types of materials to their repository, but

  are uncertain of the issues that may arise, or how these

  issues can be addressed.'
