abstract: 'The scholarly communityâ€™s dependence on electronic

  resources is rapidly increasing and those electronic

  resources are increasingly preserved in digital

  repositories or other preservation services. Whether

  locally hosted at libraries, collaboratively hosted

  between institutions, or externally hosted by a third

  party, one method for these digital repositories to take to

  assure themselves and their communities of their

  soundness is to be audited and certified by impartial

  organizations. Such independent organizations with

  staff experienced in executing audits and certifications

  can represent the interests of the academic community.

  Such staff will have the time and skills required to

  perform a thorough review of the methodologies and

  policies of each digital repository.

  Over the course of 2009, the Center for Research

  Libraries (CRL) audited Portico, a third party

  preservation service. At the conclusion of the audit,

  CRL certified Portico as a trustworthy digital repository.

  The audit was a lengthy, productive experience for

  Portico. We share the experience here both to impart the

  depth of the audit and to inform other organizations of

  what steps might be involved should they choose to be

  audited and certified.'
