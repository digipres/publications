abstract: 'This paper will examine ongoing work between two

  major preservation systems, the Chronopolis Digital

  Preservation Program, [6] and the MetaArchive

  Cooperative. [13] In the past year, these two systems

  have begun work on bridging their technical

  underpinnings to create a more robust, reliable, longlived

  preservation community for their users. The main

  emphasis of this work is moving data between a

  LOCKSS-based system (MetaArchive) and an iRODSbased

  one (Chronopolis). This work also involves

  several other emerging preservation micro-service tools

  and practices, and the expertise of the University of

  North Texas (UNT) Digital Library [21] in deploying

  them. The final result of this work is intended to be of

  three-fold benefit: 1) directly improving the services

  offered by Chronopolis and MetaArchive to their

  constituents; 2) offering specific technical findings

  which will be of benefit to other systems using

  LOCKSS and iRODS; and 3) contributing to the larger

  preservation community through the examination of

  organizational best practices for preservation system

  interactions.'
