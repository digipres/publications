abstract: This paper discusses the challenges of preserving art in the digital context.
  It provides an overview of the broader digital preservation challenge, and then
  considers new media art within that context. Through several case studies, it illustrates
  and discusses problems, issues and proposed solutions to digital art preservation.
  We will see that while work has been done towards digital preservation, significant
  issues remain.
