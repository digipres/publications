abstract: The digitization of millions of books under corporate and non-profit programs
  is dramatically expanding our ability to search, discover, and retrieve published
  materials. Accompanying this progress are cultural heritage institutions’ concerns
  about the long-term management challenges associated with providing enduring access
  to a large corpus of digitized materials, especially within the confinements of
  copyright laws. The goal of this presentation is to describe Cornell University
  Library’s program to illustrate a range of organizational and technical issues involved
  in planning and implementing a preservation infrastructure for digitized books.
