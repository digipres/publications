abstract: Quality management is one of the essential parts to become a trustworthy
  digital archive. The German network of expertise in Digital long-term preservation
  (nestor), in cooperation with the German Institute for Standards (DIN) has undertaken
  a small study in order to systematically analyse the relevance und usage of quality
  management standards for long-term preservation and to filter out the specific standardisation
  need for digital archives. This paper summarises the first results of the study.
  It gives a first overview on the differences in understanding the task “quality
  management” amongst different organisations and how they carry out appropriate measures
  like documentation, transparency, adequacy, and measureability in order to demonstrate
  the trustworthiness of their digital archive.
