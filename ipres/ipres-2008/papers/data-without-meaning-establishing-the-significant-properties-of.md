abstract: It is well recognised that the time period in which digital research may
  remain accessible is likely to be short in comparison to the period in which it
  will have intellectual value. Although many digital preservation strategies are
  effective for simple resources, it is not always possible to confirm that all of
  the significant properties – the characteristics that contribute to the intended
  meaning – have been maintained when stored in different formats and software environments.
  The paper outlines methodologies being developed by InterPARES, PLANETS and other
  projects in the international research community to support the decision-making
  process and highlights the work of four recent JISC-funded studies to specify the
  significant properties of vector images, moving images, software and learning objects.
