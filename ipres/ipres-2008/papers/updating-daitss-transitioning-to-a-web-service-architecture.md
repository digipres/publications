abstract: 'The Florida Digital Archive (FDA) is a long-term preservation repository
  for the use of the libraries of the public universities of Florida. The FDA uses
  locally-developed software called DAITSS, which was designed to perform the major
  functions of Ingest, Archival Storage, Data Management and Dissemination in the
  OAIS reference model. A DAITSS 2 project is in process to re-write the application
  based on a distributed, Web services model. This paper describes the major changes
  in store for DAITSS 2.0, the rationale behind them, and the issues involved in their
  design and implementation. These changes include: moving from a monolithic to distributed
  processing environment; implementation of modular RESTful services; incorporation
  of existing tools, services, and registries; and revising the internal data model
  to be more conformant with the PREMIS data.'
