abstract: In 2006 the Portuguese National Archives (Directorate-General of the Portuguese
  Archives) engaged in the development of an OAIS compatible digital repository system
  for long-term preservation of digital material. Simultaneously, at the University
  of Minho a project called CRiB was being devised which aimed at the development
  of a wholesome set of services to aid digital preservation. Among those services
  were format converters, quality-assessment tools, preservation planning and automatic
  metadata production for retaining representations? authenticity. This paper provides
  a detailed description of both projects and discusses how these may be integrated
  into a complete digital preservation solution based on currently available archiving
  and preservation standards, e.g. OAIS, EAD, PREMIS, METS and ANSI/NISO Z39.87.
