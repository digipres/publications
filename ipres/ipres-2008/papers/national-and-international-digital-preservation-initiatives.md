abstract: In accordance with the theme of iPres2008, this panel session will consider
  how ‘joined up’ (or otherwise) various national digital preservation initiatives
  are, and whether there is scope to increase levels of co-ordination and collaboration
  across international boundaries. The panel members will give overviews of some of
  the activities being undertaken in their respective countries, prefacing a more
  general discussion involving panel and audience to address issues arising and to
  identify opportunities and challenges.
