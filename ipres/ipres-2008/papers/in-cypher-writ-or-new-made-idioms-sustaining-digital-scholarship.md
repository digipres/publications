abstract: Digital Scholarship is a method of scholarly communication, research, and
  exchange of ideas that employs modern forms of technology, in particular, those
  forms of technology maintained within an institutionâ€™s cyberinfrastructure. Digital
  scholarship then is often, in equal parts, the intellectual content and the manner
  in which it is created and presented. That is what sets it apart from, for example,
  humanities scholarship as it has been historically undertaken in its published form.
  Thus it would follow that the sustaining of digital scholarship goes far beyond
  what is commonly known as digital preservation. In other words, sustaining digital
  scholarship is not just the difficult task of preserving the atomized digital objects
  (or even bits and bytes) but also the relationships among them. These relationships
  represent the digital world of authorial aggregation and distribution that also
  needs to be preserved. This is not a task that any one unit within a university
  can possibly undertake. This article provides an outline of activities that are
  taking place at the University of Virginia and provides some outlines and strategies
  for approaching such a complex problem set.
