abstract: The SHAMAN project targets a framework integrating advances in the data
  grid, digital library, and persistent archival communities in order to archive a
  long-term preservation environment. Within the project we identified several challenges
  for digital preservation in the area of memory institutions, where already existing
  systems start to struggle with e.g. complex or many small objects. In order to overcome
  these, we propose a grid based framework for digital preservation. In this paper
  we describe the main objectives of the project SHAMAN and the identified challenges
  for such a heterogeneous and distributed environment. We on the one hand assess
  in a bottom-up approach the capabilities and interfaces of legacy systems and on
  the other hand derive requirements based on the project’s objectives. Our investigation
  is focused to the integration of storage infrastructures and distributed data management.
  In the end we derive a service-oriented architecture with a grid-based integration
  layer as an initial approach to manage the challenges.
