abstract: The number of digital objects (and digital collections) will increase rapidly
  within the next years since mass digitisation activities have started all over the
  world. Although it is obvious that these objects are of enormous scientific and
  cultural value, some crucial aspects of ensuring their long-term preservation and
  access to them have so far not been thoroughly addressed. This means that there
  is an urgent need for developing (and implementing) new and reliable models in order
  to deliver a sound organisational and financial framework for institutions (and
  enterprises), that are concerned with digitisation and long-term preservation of
  digital objects. To this purpose the Bavarian State Library (BSB) and the University
  of the Federal Armed Forces Munich, are carrying out a study, funded by the German
  Research Foundation (DFG), that explicitly addresses the perceived shortcomings
  by analysing the current state of long-term preservation in Germany, developing
  solutions in the form of scalable business and organisational models and clarifying
  the agenda for further research.
