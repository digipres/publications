abstract: Government’s use of the Web has required new approaches to Web resource
  preservation. The National Archives’ approach draws on its experience of Web Archiving,
  as well as expertise in the live Web arena. By harnessing these two elements, The
  National Archives hopes to deliver a truly innovative user-centric service predicated
  on preserving the content of websites as well as utilizing the value of the Web
  as a network.
