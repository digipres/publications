abstract: Over the past 20 years, more than 100,000 CD-ROM titles have been published
  including thousands of collections of government documents and data. CDROMs present
  preservation challenges at the bit level and in ensuring usability of the preserved
  artifact. We present techniques we have developed to archive and enable user access
  to a collection of approximately 2,900 CD-ROMs published under the Federal Depository
  Library Program (FDLP) by the United States Government Printing Office (GPO). The
  project provides web-based access to CDROM contents using both migration and emulation
  and supports remote execution of the raw CD-ROM images. Our project incorporates
  off-the-shelf, primarily opensource software. The raw data and (METS) metadata are
  made available through AFS, a standard distributed file system, to encourage sharing
  among libraries.
