abstract: 'There are relatively few digital preservation policies within institutions:
  is digital preservation a subject of no importance? This paper presents ongoing
  work and findings from a JISC funded study on institutional digital preservation
  policies which aims to provide an outline model for digital preservation policies
  and in particular to analyse the role that digital preservation can play in supporting
  and delivering key strategies for Higher Education Institutions in areas such as
  research and teaching and learning. Although focussing on the UK Higher Education
  sector, the study draws widely on policy and implementations from other sectors
  and countries and will be of interest to those wishing to develop policy and justify
  investment in digital preservation within a wide range of institutions.'
