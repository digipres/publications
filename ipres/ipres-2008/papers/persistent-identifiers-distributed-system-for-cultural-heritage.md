abstract: In this paper, we present a prototype with a novel resolution architecture
  for an URN based Persistent Identifiers (PI) system in Italy. We describe a distribute
  approach for implementing the NBN namespace system and illustrate the solutions
  adopted for the assignment and resolution of the identifiers with the hierarchical
  and peer-to-peer request forwarding. Starting from the core motivations for ‘persistent
  identifiers’ for digital objects, we draw up a state of art of PI technologies,
  standards and initiatives, like other NBN implementations. The prototype is still
  under development and we present the next steps, in particular we describe the interoperability
  perspective that already partially foresees the NBN prototype.
