abstract: This paper presents a conceptual framework for the use of the SOA1-approach
  in the digital preservation. The focus of this work reflects the service composition
  part within the SOA service concept. Previously released approaches have been separately
  using process-oriented models to describe the behaviour of services, and structure
  composition models to represent service interactions. In this paper, the authors
  attempt to combine the even mentioned disjunctive models to obtain a comprehensive
  model, which represents both, the structure and the behaviour of the services. For
  this purpose, the novel SCA2-BPEL3 serves as basis for the implementation in a future-oriented
  SOA-compliant digital preservation software system. The SCA-model specifies the
  architecture of the intended system, while the BPEL-model indicates the behavior
  of each service, which is defined in the SCA-model. We can conclude that the SCA-BPEL
  approach is well-suited for building a scalable, adaptable and service-oriented
  software system. The knowledge gained from the conceptual framework will serve as
  a basis for future digital preservation developments.
