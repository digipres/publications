abstract: Implementation of a digital repository involves much more than just the
  installation of the required hardware and software. It is clear from the implementation
  path undertaken by the Antwerp City Archives over the past year and a half that
  it is also an organisational issue and requires fundamental consideration of core
  records management and recordkeeping issues.
