abstract: 'Over the last several decades, U.S. supercomputing centers such as the
  San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), the National Center for Supercomputer Applications
  (NCSA), and the Texas Advanced Computer Center (TACC), along with national partnerships
  such as the National Partnership for Advanced Computational Infrastructure (NPACI)
  and TeraGrid have developed a rich tradition of support for advanced computing applications
  and infrastructure. In addition, these centers have developed some of the worlds
  longest continually operating archives of digital information. These characteristics
  enable such nationally-funded centers to become natural partners for the library
  and archive communities as they develop digital preservation infrastructure. Concepts
  which will be critically important to the development of long-term preservation
  networks, including cyberinfrastructure and data grids, have grown out of the National
  Science Foundation and its programs for supercomputer centers. The centers have
  also served as hosts for long-running development and testing of software tools
  for data management in distributed environments, including the SRB and iRODS data
  grid software. These centers are also natural sites for the deployment of necessary
  physical and virtualized cyberinfrastructure for digital preservation. Several important
  current and past initiatives, from InterPARES (Duranti) to Chronopolis have involved
  staff and resources at supercomputing centers working directly with archives and
  libraries.

  Along with these opportunities, there are significant challenges to the integration
  of the current infrastructure involved in the support of advanced computational
  science, on the one hand, and services that support the community needs for digital
  preservation on the other. This paper provides an overview of software development
  and deployments in the context of supercomputing centers and national partnerships,
  describing foundational cyberinfrastructure efforts, which provide physical and
  logical support for more advanced digital collection and preservation projects in
  both the sciences and the humanities. The paper then surveys some important recent
  work at sites in the NSFâ€™s national cyberinfrastructure project, the TeraGrid, related
  to the digital preservation arena. It also examines two projects that the Library
  of Congress'' National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program
  Program (NDIIPP) has funded at SDSC to study large-scale, long-term digital archives.
  These projects provide valuable examples of collaborative digital preservation practice
  within the context of a shared U.S. cyberinfrastructure.

  Finally, we consider the possibilities for further development of digital preservation
  infrastructure and partnerships within the Teragrid and across international boundaries.
  The character of digital preservation development outside of the United States is
  briefly considered and compared, and future directions for international efforts
  are evaluated.'
