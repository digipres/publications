abstract: Several ways to deal with complexity are discussed. An archive can handle
  the matter by keeping the number of the single elements in the core areas of digital
  preservation down. The numbers of action types during the ingest process, of metadata
  and journals could be reduced. A preservation model for analogue and digital records
  is outlined. By keeping complexity down, it’s easier to see what digital and analogue
  archiving have in common. Instead of seeing two totally different worlds (here is
  the old one, there is the new one), one can shift to a less revolutionary view.
  This makes it possible to fall back on the considerable implicit knowledge of the
  existing memory institutions. From the perspective of the whole archive, there are
  strong arguments for reducing complexity and keeping digital and analogue things
  together whenever possible. Complexity can also be handled by cooperation. The Landesarchiv
  Baden-Württemberg appreciates the opportunity to use the software tools DROID and
  JHOVE. The BOA project is a further example for a venture in website archiving that
  is maintained by libraries and archives collaboratively. Cooperation and the reduction
  of complexity are the two most promising ways to enable small and medium sized archives
  to start with digital preservation. Automation seems to be a good thing whenever
  it can be achieved, but until this stage is reached, the single steps and the standards
  which must be followed often are extremely complex.
