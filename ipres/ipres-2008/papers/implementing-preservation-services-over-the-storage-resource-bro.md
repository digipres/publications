abstract: Many international institutions and organizations responsible for managing
  large distributed collections of scientific, cultural and educational resources
  are establishing data grids that employ the San Diego Supercomputer Centre’s Storage
  Resource Broker (SRB) for managing their collections. Over time, maintaining access
  to the resources stored within SRB data grids will become increasingly difficult
  as file formats become obsolete. Organizations are struggling with the challenge
  of monitoring the formats in their SRB collections and providing suitable migration
  or emulation services as required. Automated methods are required that notify collections
  managers of objects that are at risk and that provide solutions to ensure long term
  access. The problem is exacerbated by the often proprietary and highly eclectic
  range of formats employed by scientific disciplines – many of which are too uncommon
  to be considered by existing national digital preservation initiatives. This paper
  describes our test bed implementation of a set of preservation services (obsolescence
  detection, notification and migration) over a heterogeneous distributed collection
  of objects, stored in SRB. It also provides an evaluation of the performance and
  usability of the PresSRB system, within the context of an environmental case study.
