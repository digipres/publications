abstract: Establishing metadata requirements is a key challenge for any attempt to
  implement a digital preservation repository. The repositoryâ€™s capacity to provide
  costeffective, trustworthy services largely derives from the metadata it uses. This
  paper describes the metadata posited to support services the Chronopolis preservation
  system will offer at the conclusion of its first year of development.
