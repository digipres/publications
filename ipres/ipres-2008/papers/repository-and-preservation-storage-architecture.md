abstract: 'While the Open Archive Information System (OAIS) model has become the de
  facto standard for preservation archives, the design and implementation of a repository
  or reliable long term archive lacks adopted technology standards and design best
  practices. This paper is intended to provide guidelines and recommendations for
  standards implementation and best practices for a viable, cost effective, and reliable
  repository and preservation storage architecture. This architecture is based on
  a combination of open source and commercially supported software and systems.

  Although several operating systems currently exist, the logical choice for an archive
  storage system is an open source operating system, of which  there are two primary
  choices today: Linux and Solaris. There are many varieties of Linux available and
  supported by nearly all system manufacturers. The Solaris Operating System is freely
  downloadable from Sun Microsystems. Many variants of the Linux operating system
  and Solaris are available with support on a fee base.

  The Hierarchical Storage System, or HSM, is a key software element of the archive.
  The HSM provides one of the key components that contributes to reliability by through
  data integrity checks and automated file migration. The HSM provides the ability
  to automate making multiples copies of files, auditing files for errors based on
  checksum, rejecting bad copies of files and making new copies based on the results
  of those audits. The HSM also provides the ability to read in an older file format
  and write-out a new file format thus migrating the format and application information
  required to ensure archival integrity of the stored content. The automation of these
  functions provides for improved performance and reduced operating costs.

  The Sun StorageTek Storage Archive Manager (SAM) software provides the core functionality
  of the recommended preservation storage architecture. SAM provides policy based
  data classification and placement across a multitude of storage devices from high
  speed disk, low cost disk, or tape. SAM also simplifies data management by providing
  centralized metadata. SAM is a self-protecting file system with continuous file
  integrity checks.

  The digital content archive provides the content repository (or digital vault) within
  Sun''s award-winning Digital Asset Management Reference Architecture (DAM RA). DAM
  RA enables digital workflow and the content archive provides permanent access to
  digital content files.

  With SAM software, the files are stored, tracked, and retrieved based on the archival
  requirements. Files are seamlessly and transparently available to other services.
  SAM software creates virtually limitless capacity. Its scalability allows for continual
  growth throughout the archive with support for all data types. The policy based
  SAM software stores and manages data for compliance and non-compliance archives
  using a tiered storage approach with integrated disk and tape into a seamless storage
  solution, SAM software simplifies the archive storage. Allows you to automate data
  management policies based on file attributes. You can manage data according to the
  storage and access requirements of each user on the system and decide how data is
  grouped, copied, and accessed based on the needs of the application and the users.
  Helps you maximize return on investments by storing data on the media type appropriate
  for the life cycle of the data and simplifying system administration.

  Sun Open Storage solutions provide the systems built with an open architecture using
  industry-standard hardware and opensource software. This open architecture allows
  the most flexible selection of the hardware and software components to best meet
  storage requirements. In a closed storage environment, all the components of a closed
  system must come from the vendor. Customers are locked into buying disk drives,
  controllers, and proprietary software features from a single vendor at premium prices
  and typically cannot add their own drives or software to improve functionality or
  reduce the cost of the closed system. Long term preservation is directly dependant
  on the long term viability of the software components. Open source solutions offer
  the most viable long term option with open access and community based development
  and support.'
