abstract: Although vast quantities of data are being created within higher education,
  few institutions have formal strategies in place for curating these research outputs
  in the longterm. Moreover there appears to be a lack of awareness as to exactly
  what data are held and whether they are being managed. In response to these concerns
  the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) issued a call for proposals to develop
  and implement a Data Audit Framework suited to the needs of the UK higher education
  research communities. The Data Audit Framework (DAF) Development project was funded
  to produce an audit methodology, online toolkit, and a registry. Four additional
  implementation projects were funded to test the toolkit and promote its uptake.
  This paper outlines the audit methodology, introduces the online toolkit, and provides
  feedback on implementing the Data Audit Framework.
