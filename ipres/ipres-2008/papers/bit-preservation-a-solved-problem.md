abstract: 'For years, discussions of digital preservation have routinely featured
  comments such as “bit preservation is a solved problem; the real issues are . .
  . ”. Indeed, current digital storage technologies are not just astoundingly cheap
  and capacious, they are astonishingly reliable. Unfortunately, these attributes
  drive a kind of “Parkinson’s Law” of storage, in which demands continually push
  beyond the capabilities of systems implementable at an affordable price. This paper
  is in four parts:

  • Claims, reviewing a typical claim of storage system reliability, showing that
  it provides no useful information for bit preservation purposes.

  • Theory, proposing “bit half-life” as an initial measure of bit preservation performance,
  expressing bit preservation requirements in terms of it, and showing that the requirements
  being placed on bit preservation systems are so onerous that the experiments required
  to prove that a solution exists are not feasible.

  • Practice, reviewing recent research into how well actual storage systems preserve
  bits, showing that they fail to meet the requirements by many orders of magnitude.

  • Policy, suggesting ways of dealing with this unfortunate situation.'
