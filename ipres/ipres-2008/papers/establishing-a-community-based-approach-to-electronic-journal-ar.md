abstract: Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe (LOCKSS1) represents a sophisticated combination
  of technical and business-aware elements that can be deployed to ensure the longterm
  accessibility to electronic journal content even if the publisher ceases to exist,
  a subscription is terminated, or the already acquired content becomes damaged. Given
  the potential benefits of LOCKSS to the UK community, and in consideration of the
  implications of the NESLi2 licences, the Joint Information Systems Committee2 and
  the Consortium of University Research Libraries3 (JISC/CURL) co-funded a UK LOCKSS
  Pilot Programme to explore issues associated with the practical implementation of
  LOCKSS in UK Higher Education institutions. The pilot launched in March 2006 and
  concluded in July 2008. Following on from our experiences throughout the UK LOCKSS
  Pilot Programme, this paper discusses the organizational attributes of the LOCKSS
  approach that we expect to further develop in the UK, describes the types of journal
  content that the current generation of LOCKSS seems best suited to handle and as
  a result how LOCKSS may fit into the broader journal archiving environment, and
  it describes the steps we are taking to ensure both the LOCKSS software and Technical
  Support Service grow effectively to support library use and information management.
