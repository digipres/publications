abstract: The move to digital is being accompanied by a huge rise in volumes of (born-digital)
  content and data. As a result the curation lifecycle has to be redrawn. Processes
  such as selection and evaluation for preservation have to be driven by automation.
  Manual processes will not scale, and the traditional signifiers and selection criteria
  in older formats, such as print publication, are changing. The paper will examine
  at a conceptual and practical level how preservation intelligence can be built into
  softwarebased digital preservation tools and services on the Web and across the
  network ‘cloud’ to create ‘smart’ storage for long-term, continuous data monitoring
  and management. Some early examples will be presented, focussing on storage management
  and format risk assessment.
