abstract: The JHOVE characterization framework is widely used by international digital
  library programs and preservation repositories. However, its extensive use over
  the past four years has revealed a number of limitations imposed by idiosyncrasies
  of design and implementation. With funding from the Library of Congress under its
  National Digital Information Infrastructure Preservation Program (NDIIPP), the California
  Digital Library, Portico, and Stanford University are collaborating on a two year
  project to develop and deploy a next-generation architecture providing enhanced
  performance, streamlined APIs, and significant new features. The JHOVE2 project
  generalizes the concept of format characterization to include identification, validation,
  feature extraction, and policy-based assessment. The target of this characterization
  is not a simple digital file, but a (potentially) complex digital object that may
  be instantiated in multiple files.
