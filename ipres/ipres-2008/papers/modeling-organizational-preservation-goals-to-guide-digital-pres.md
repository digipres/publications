abstract: Digital preservation activities can only succeed if they go beyond the technical
  properties of digital objects. They must consider the strategy, policy, goals, and
  constraints of the institution that undertakes them and take into account the cultural
  and institutional framework in which data, documents and records are preserved.
  Furthermore, because organizations differ in many ways, a one-sizefits-all approach
  cannot be appropriate. Fortunately, organizations involved in digital preservation
  have created documents describing their policies, strategies, workflows, plans,
  and goals to provide guidance. They also have skilled staff who are aware of sometimes
  unwritten considerations. Within Planets [Farquhar 2007], a four-year project cofunded
  by the European Union to address core digital preservation challenges, we have analyzed
  preservation guiding documents and interviewed staff from libraries, archives, and
  data centers that are actively engaged in digital preservation. This paper introduces
  a conceptual model for expressing the core concepts and requirements that appear
  in preservation guiding documents. It defines a specific vocabulary that institutions
  can reuse for expressing their own policies and strategies. In addition to providing
  a conceptual framework, the model and vocabulary support automated preservation
  planning tools through an XML representation.
