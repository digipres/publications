abstract: Emulation1 used as a long-term preservation strategy offers the possibility
  to keep digital objects in their original condition and experience them within their
  original computer environment. However, having only an emulator in place is not
  enough. To apply emulation as a fully-fledged strategy, an automated and user-friendly
  approach is required. This can not be done without knowledge of the original software
  and contextual information about it. This paper combines the existing concept of
  a view path, which captures contextual information of software, together with new
  insights to improve the concept with extra metadata. It provides regularly updated
  instructions for archival management to preserve and access its artifacts. The view
  path model requires extensions of the metadata set of primary object of interest
  and depends on additionally stored secondary objects for environment recreation
  like applications or operating systems. This paper also addresses a strategy to
  render digital objects by running emulation processes on distance. The advantages
  of this strategy are that it improves user convenience while maximizing emulation
  capabilities.
