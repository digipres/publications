abstract: Digital preservation is too big a challenge for any institution or solution
  supplier to confront on its own. The success of any long-term digital repository
  will depend upon multiple “open” services provided by a wide range of service providers.
  No company or organisation in the world is able to provide the preservation solution
  for all known formats, object types, or policies. Viable approaches are likely to
  span organizational, institutional and national boundaries. In 2003 the KB, National
  Library of the Netherlands, in cooperation with IBM, developed the e-Depot as their
  solution for long-term preservation of digital publications. The core of the e-Depot
  is IBM’s Digital Information Archiving System (DIAS). This article will discuss
  the exercise of the KB/IBM Research Group to apply IBM’s Component Business Modelling
  (CBM) in a digital preservation environment. The CBM map is used by a process called
  Goal Service Modelling (GSM) to identify candidate services for future versions
  of the e-Depot. Heat maps are used for impact analysis – to discuss organisational
  structures, existing hardware and software solutions and business processes in the
  context of the CBM map. The approach is suggested as a way for other repositories
  to manage and coordinate their activities, as well complimenting current repository
  audit and certification activities.
