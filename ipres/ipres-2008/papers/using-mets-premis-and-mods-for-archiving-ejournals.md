abstract: As institutions turn towards developing archival digital repositories, many
  decisions on the use of metadata have to be made. In addition to deciding on the
  more traditional descriptive and administrative metadata, particular care needs
  to be given to the choice of structural and preservation metadata, as well as to
  integrating the various metadata components. This paper reports on the use of METS
  structural, PREMIS preservation and MODS descriptive metadata for the British Libraryâ€™s
  eJournal system.
