abstract: The International Study on the Impact of Copyright Law on Digital Preservation
  reviewed digital preservation activities and the current state of copyright and
  related laws and their impact on digital preservation in Australia, the Netherlands,
  the United Kingdom and the United States. In many cases, digital works are not being
  preserved in any systematic way, in part because digital preservation triggers copyright
  concerns in a way that analogue preservation does not. All the countries have some
  form of preservation exception. However, there is an inconsistent approach in the
  details and uncertainty as to how they may apply in the digital environment. None
  of the countries have a uniform national system collecting digital materials. Technological
  protection measures and private contracts may in some cases present significant
  practical barriers to preservation.. Current approaches to address these legal barriers
  are ad hoc and include approaching individual rights holders and some use of model
  licences. There are as yet no effective solutions to the issue of orphan works.
  Recommendations of the study include suggestions for drafting national policies
  and adapting laws with the aim of allowing preservation activities to be undertaken
  as necessary and in accordance with international best practice standards and to
  allow a uniform national system for the collection of digital materials by relevant
  state and national collecting institutions.
