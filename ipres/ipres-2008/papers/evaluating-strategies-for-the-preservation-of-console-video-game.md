abstract: The amount of content from digital origin permanently increases. The short
  lifespan of digital media makes it necessary to develop strategies to preserve its
  content for future use. Not only electronic documents, pictures and movies have
  to be preserved, also interactive content like digital art or video games have to
  be kept “alive” for future generations. In this paper we discuss strategies for
  the digital preservation of console video games. We look into challenges like proprietary
  hardware and unavailable documentation as well as the big variety of media and non-standard
  controllers. Then a case study on console video game preservation is shown utilizing
  the Planets preservation planning approach for evaluating preservation strategies
  in a documented decision-making process. While previous case studies concentrated
  on migration, we compared emulation and migration using a requirements tree. Experiments
  were carried out to compare different emulators as well as other approaches first
  for a single console video game system, then for different console systems of the
  same era and finally for systems of all eras. Comparison and discussion of results
  show that, while emulation works in principle very well for early console video
  games, various problems exist for the general use as a digital preservation alternative.
  It also shows that the Planets preservation planning workflow can be used for both
  emulation and migration in the same planning process and that the selection of suitable
  sample records is crucial.
