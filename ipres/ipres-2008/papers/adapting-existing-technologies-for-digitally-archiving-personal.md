abstract: The adoption of existing technologies for digital curation, most especially
  digital capture, is outlined in the context of personal digital archives and the
  Digital Manuscripts Project at the British Library. Technologies derived from computer
  forensics, data conversion and classic computing, and evolutionary computing are
  considered. The practical imperative of moving information to modern and fresh media
  as soon as possible is highlighted, as is the need to retain the potential for researchers
  of the future to experience the original look and feel of personal digital objects.
  The importance of not relying on any single technology is also emphasised.
