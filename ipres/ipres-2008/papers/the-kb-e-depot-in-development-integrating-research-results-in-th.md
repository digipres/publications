abstract: 'The mission of the KB e-Depot is to ensure permanent access to large quantities
  of digital resources in a national and international context. Operating an international
  e-journal archive at a relatively small organization such as the KB asks for a firm
  foundation of its policy. With support from the Dutch government, the KB has succeeded
  in setting up two expert teams: an operational team responsible for daily operations
  of the e-Depot (based in the Acquisitions & Processing Division) and an active research
  team that secures continuing research and development to secure long-term preservation
  and perpetual access to electronic information (based in the Research & Development
  Division). The experience gained in operating an archive is directly used in system-
  and process improvements. As are the results of the projects in which the R&D team
  is involved. The organisation around the e-Depot is based on this pragmatic approach.'
