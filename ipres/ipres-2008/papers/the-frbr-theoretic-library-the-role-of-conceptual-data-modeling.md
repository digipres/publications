abstract: The use of digital technologies in support of Cultural Heritage missions
  has highlighted the need to create information modeling systems different from those
  that are used in conventional business and government. In addition, the practice
  of data modeling â€“ and especially of the conceptual data modeling that engages cataloging
  theory and practice - must be urgently be brought up to date in order to develop
  the data models required to represent the desirable characteristics of both print
  and digital media.
