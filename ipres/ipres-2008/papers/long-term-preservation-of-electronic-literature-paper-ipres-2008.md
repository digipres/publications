abstract: 'Authors have always been looking for new and innovative ways of aesthetical
  expression and they have been quick to take advantage of the new possibilities,
  offered by the World Wide Web and the Internet. Today, there is a respectable community
  – in terms of size and quality – of “digital poets”, who publish their texts in
  the internet and whose literature above all shares one mutual feature: a prominent
  and crucial use of computer technologies. Being the cultural heritage for future
  generations, electronic literature is worth preserving, just as any other form of
  contemporary literature. Yet, due to its use of interactive and dynamic elements
  and reliance on the latest technology, contemporary electronic literature is extremely
  vulnerable and difficult to document. While archives, libraries and museums are
  still trying to develop preservation strategies for electronic literature, many
  of the early works have already volatilized. In Germany, two institutions and a
  cooperative network have joined forces in order to address this challenge concertedly:
  nestor, the network of expertise in long-term storage of digital resources, the
  German Literature Archive, and the German National Library.'
