abstract: Research has been studied to evaluate the reliability of storage media and
  the reliability of a computer backup system. In this paper, we use the Continuous
  Time Markov Chain to model and analyze the reliability of a computer backup system.
  We propose a modified model from that of the Constantopoulos, Doerr and Petraki
  [1]. We analyze the difference, show computational results, and propose new input
  parameters (e.g. time to repair) for the model from our experience. Further we developed
  a four-copy data model to test if it fulfills the sample reliability rate set by
  the RLGNARA. The modeling process can be applied to construct models for computer
  preservation systems using different storage media. The reliability of constructed
  models can be calculated so that preservation institutions can have quantitative
  data to decide their preservation strategies.
