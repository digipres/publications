abstract: "The British Library (BL) Digital Library Programme (DLP) has a broad set
  of objectives to achieve over the next few years, from web-archiving to the ingest
  of e-journals through to mass digitisation of newspapers and books. These projects
  are decided by the DLP programme board and are managed by the wider corporate governance
  structure which includes our legal deposit responsibilities. As part of this work
  it was identified by the Digital Preservation Team (DPT) that a significant number
  of handheld media (CDROM, DVD, Tape) within the BL collections may be at increased
  risk of obsolescence or decay due to the increased time they may spend on handheld
  media. The DPT and DLP agreed that an assessment should be undertaken and the results
  used to help prioritize future ingest. \nThe DPT conducted this risk assessment
  exercise in order to assess the condition of the BL digital collections, identify
  strategies to mitigate those risks, and recommend and plan actions to be taken.
  A risk assessment methodology based on the AS/NZS 4360:2004 standard was applied
  in a representative manner across these collections. The Risk Assessment concluded
  that the BL’s digital collections face an array of risks that will require action
  on a number of fronts. Almost all of the hand held (physical carrier) collections
  were assessed to be at high risk. The greatest and most imminent threat of loss
  is from media degradation. Failure rates for discs within the collections have reached
  high levels (up to 3%). Additionally substantial quantities of digital objects are
  stored as single copies only, on handheld media in danger of decay. This stark warning
  was illustrated by many examples of disc decay that have been encountered and is
  backed up by the evidence from external research into handheld media lifetimes.
  Digital content will continue to be lost unless action is taken now. The report
  made a number of specific recommendations to mitigate the highest risks facing the
  BL’s digital collections. These include:\n- Secure collections that are currently
  stored on handheld media as a matter of urgency. (Move the collections from CD/DVD
  etc)\n- Perform further assessment to gain a better understanding of the media failure
  rates across the different collections\n- Address the root causes of a number of
  the risks facing the collections, by streamlining and enhancing standards, check-in
  procedures and other policy issues \nIn order to achieve this a number of organisational
  changes have had to be undertaken that will eventually become measurable benefits."
