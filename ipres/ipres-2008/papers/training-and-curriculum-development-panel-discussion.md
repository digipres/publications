abstract: The Training and Curriculum Development Session at iPRES 2008 will bring
  together a range of experts actively involved in the international digital preservation
  training arena. Through a series of presentations and modulated discussion it is
  hoped that the session will be of interest and value to both practitioners and managers
  who are seeking to find a path through this sometimes fragmented area.
