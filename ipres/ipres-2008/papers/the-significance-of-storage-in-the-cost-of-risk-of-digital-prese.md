abstract: As storage costs drop, storage is becoming the lowest cost in a digital
  repository – and the biggest risk. We examine current modelling of costs and risks
  in digital preservation, concentrating on the Total Cost of Risk when using digital
  storage systems for preserving audiovisual material. We present a managed approach
  to preservation, and the vital role of storage and show how planning for long-term
  preservation of data should consider the risks involved in using digital storage
  technology. Gaps in information necessary for accurate modeling – and planning –
  are presented. We call for new functionality to support recovery of files with errors,
  to eliminate the all-or-nothing approach of current IT systems, reduce the impact
  of failures of digital storage technology and mitigate against loss of digital data.
