abstract: Processing information stored as data in a specific data format is tightly
  coupled with software implementations that handle necessary elementary processes
  such as reading and writing. These implementations depend on specific technological
  environments and thus age due to rapid technological change. The resulting effective
  loss of information is a major problem for Digital Preservation. In order to provide
  for persistent, authentic access to stored information, this paper presents a logic-based
  approach for the formal specification of data formats.
