abstract: The team behind Cornell University Library Archival Repository (CULAR) has
  made the conscious and deliberate decision to preference human-mediated workflows
  in developing its digital preservation program. This has allowed them to remain
  responsive to the needs of their colleagues rather than trying to fit the practices
  of many departments into a single monolithic system. This paper traces the evolution
  of Cornellâ€™s digital preservation program, highlighting the inflection points that
  informed how the service developed and operates today.
