abstract: This paper uses as a lens the work of Wenger, McDermott, and Snyder in their
  seminal text, “Cultivating Communities of Practice” to explore the structural model
  and stages of development of the Australasia Preserves community of practice for
  digital preservation and archiving practitioners in the Australasian region. It
  presents a case study with regional examples and reflection over seven years of
  the community’s existence. Through examination of the formation, practice, experiences
  of core coordinators, and the current state of the community, this paper aims to
  further community building efforts in the field of digital preservation and contribute
  to global discussions on this topic.
