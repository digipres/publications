abstract: "As university libraries, one of our key missions is to preserve scholarly
  digital content for future generations.\nThis implies safeguarding our own digital
  collections, of which we are the sole custodian, as these often include unique materials
  created by our scientific community. Examples include Ph.D. theses, offprints, and
  research data.\nWe must also ensure enduring access to subscribed scholarly content
  even if the subscription is canceled or if publishers discontinue publications.
  \nTo meet these challenges, we encourage libraries to adopt a global strategy based
  on three solutions leveraging the LOCKSS open-source technology. \nOur poster depicts
  the implementation of this 3-pillar strategy at Universit√© libre de Bruxelles (ULB)
  :\n\n**1. Community network**\nWhile a university library alone is unlikely to have
  the required human and technological resources to build an efficient distributed
  preservation solution, LOCKSS technology makes it easy for libraries to build their
  own community network to safeguard their collections of interest. \nFollowing this
  approach, ULB - together with 6 university partners worldwide - has funded the SAFEPLN
  network in 2014. \nContent is collected from our institutional repositories and
  replicated in seven preservation nodes, distributed across servers hosted in Europe
  and Canada.\nCurrently, a dozen similar networks have been created worldwide, with
  various objectives, scopes and organizational models.\n\n**2. Global LOCKSS Network**\nAs
  a solution for post-cancellation access to our electronic resources, ULB joined
  the Global LOCKSS Network in 2012.\nIf we terminate a subscription to one of our
  resources or the resource becomes temporarily unavailable from the publisher, a
  copy remains available in our local server and we can restore access to our users.\n\n**3.
  CLOCKSS**\nUnfortunately, not all our key electronic resources are available on
  the Global LOCKSS network. Therefore, ULB also chose to support the CLOCKSS service
  from 2024. \nCLOCKSS is a dark archive encompassing over 54 million journal articles,
  and 475.000 e-books from the world's leading publishers, ensuring open access if
  content disappears from the web.\n\nThe three-pillar approach outlined here empowers
  libraries to take charge of their digital preservation. Instead of relying on third-party
  solutions, we become active players in preservation, embracing our essential mission."
