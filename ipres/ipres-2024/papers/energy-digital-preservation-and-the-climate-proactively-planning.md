abstract: Energy is the currency of life and the foundation for all digital preservation
  activities. It is energy, in the form of electricity, which allows us to write physical
  marks on various substrates and energy which allows us to read those marks. The
  industrial revolution, powered by coal and oil, supercharged our technology by greatly
  increasing the amount of energy available to us at only the cost of extraction.
  This surge of cheap energy into our civilization was what allowed us to advance
  our technology and develop computers and the digital realm. As we move into the
  middle of this century, energy will affect our ability to preserve digital materials
  in two critical ways. First, the age of cheap oil is coming to an end. As oil becomes
  more expensive to extract, less and less energy will be available. Second, the byproducts
  of burning fossil fuels such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrogen, create greenhouse
  gasses (GHGs) which have warmed our atmosphere and destabilized our climate. The
  more energy we use from fossil fuels, the more we create an inhospitable planet.
  In order to proactively plan for the future ahead of us, the digital preservation
  community needs to become aware of the risks inherent in our critical dependency
  on energy and enact adaptation strategies to address those threats. Methodologies,
  like those presented in the Decision Making Under Deep Uncertainty (DMDU) suite,
  provide a way of selecting strategies that are adaptive to multiple futures. While
  thereâ€™s no way of knowing what the future will bring, the current state of our climate
  guarantees that it will not be business as usual.
