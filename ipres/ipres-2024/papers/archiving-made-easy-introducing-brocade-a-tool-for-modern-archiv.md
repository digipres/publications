abstract: In today's fast-paced digital age, effective archiving and documentation
  play pivotal roles in maintaining organizational efficiency and preserving valuable
  information. This paper presents a demonstration of a tool designed to streamline
  the archiving process and enhance documentation practices. The tool offers intuitive
  features aimed at simplifying the capture, organization, and retrieval of information,
  thereby reducing the time and effort required for archiving tasks. Through a series
  of practical examples and hands-on demonstrations, this presentation showcases the
  tool's capabilities, like e.g. OAI-MPH and IIIF, and illustrates its potential to
  revolutionize archiving practices across various domains.
