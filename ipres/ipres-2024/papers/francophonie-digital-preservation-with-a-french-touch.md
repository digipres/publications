abstract: 'The digital preservation field predominantly relies on English-language
  resources and documentation, presenting significant challenges for the Francophone
  community. Factors like staff training and the utilization of accented characters
  in alphabets exacerbate these difficulties, warranting targeted solutions to enhance
  Francophone contributions to the global digital preservation discourse.


  In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, English has emerged as the lingua franca,
  shaping the discourse and dissemination of knowledge. Consequently, most technical
  discussions, guides, and scholarly articles pertinent to digital preservation are
  predominantly available in English. This linguistic hegemony poses barriers for
  Francophones seeking active engagement in digital preservation efforts. Language
  barriers not only impede comprehension and participation but also limit access to
  cutting-edge knowledge and practices within the field.


  Addressing these challenges is imperative to ensure equitable representation and
  active involvement of the Francophone community in digital preservation endeavors.
  Efforts must be directed towards enhancing staff training by providing resources
  and professional development programs in the native language of Francophones. Additionally,
  unique challenges associated with utilizing alphabets containing accented characters
  must be acknowledged and resolved to facilitate effective data management and preservation
  in Francophone contexts.


  The "birds of a feather" session presents a singular opportunity to convene the
  Francophone digital preservation community for face-to-face discussions. This gathering
  will enable participants to share experiences, address challenges, and exchange
  best practices in an environment conducive to collaboration and idea-sharing. By
  bringing together Francophone experts and practitioners in digital preservation,
  this session aims to strengthen community bonds and identify innovative solutions
  to overcome linguistic and technical barriers. Through collaborative efforts, we
  can ensure that the Francophone voice is fully heard and its contributions enrich
  the global digital preservation landscape during iPRES 2024.'
