abstract: "As research data grows in volume and complexity, concerns about maintaining
  long-term access to valuable datasets are heightened. Preservationists need comprehensive
  information about datasets' creation, relevance, and long-term value to support
  informed preservation decisions. Our proposed solution is to involve data curators
  in appraisal for preservation early in the dataset deposit processing order to capture
  the richest possible understanding of a datasetâ€™s current and perceived long-term
  usefulness. By leveraging their unique position working with depositors, curators
  can collect essential information to inform preservation decisions and reduce duplication
  of effort in (re)appraisal over time. \n\nIn this poster presentation, we will share
  recent efforts to finalize and publish an appraisal checklist to be used by data
  curators at the point of ingest, in their interactions with depositors, and then
  later, by preservationists during a (re)appraisal process. Join us to explore how
  integrating long-term appraisal into data curation can ensure better decision-making
  by preservationists over the long-term, minimizing environmental costs and duplication
  of effort while also preparing better for changes in ongoing research needs."
