abstract: "Archives are treasure troves of historical and cultural information, but
  they are often inaccessible or unappealing to the general public. \n\nHow can we
  use conversational AI to create engaging and immersive experiences that bring the
  past to life? How can we design narratives that are faithful to the archival sources,
  but also adaptable to the interests and needs of the users? How can we leverage
  the rich audiovisual material in the archives, without resorting to long and boring
  texts? \nThese are some of the questions that we will explore in this interactive
  workshop, where participants will learn how to use conversational AI to create dialogues
  with the past.\n\nThe workshop will consist of three parts:\n·\tA brief introduction
  to the concept and potential of conversational AI in archives, with examples from
  VRT's projects and experiments.\n·\tA hands-on session where participants will work
  in groups to design and prototype conversational AI scenarios for different archival
  contexts, such as news, Video/audio-on-demand platforms, and education.\n·\tA plenary
  discussion where participants will share and reflect on their prototypes, and receive
  feedback from the workshop facilitators and other participants.\n\nThe workshop
  is aimed at anyone who is interested in exploring the possibilities of conversational
  AI in archives, whether they are archivists, researchers, journalists, educators,
  or storytellers. No prior technical or design skills are required, only curiosity
  and creativity. \n\nBy the end of the workshop, participants will have gained a
  basic understanding of the principles and challenges of conversational AI in archives,
  and will have developed some ideas and skills to apply it in their own contexts."
