abstract: "The [Program Vitam][1] is a French cross-ministerial project, whose main
  goal is to develop an [open source recordkeeping software][2] (back-office and front-office).
  The project has been drawn up since 2011 and organized using an innovative approach
  in France, for archives and recordkeeping sectors, but also for public services
  in general, involving records managers, archivists and IT professionals. In addition
  to its funding ministries (Culture, Foreign Affairs, Defense), it now has more than
  seventy partners from the public and the private sectors.\n\nThe software development
  is using Agile method. It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development,
  early delivery, continuous improvement, and fosters rapid and flexible response
  to change. But on top of that, the project focuses on user satisfaction. This implies
  an active collaboration between archivists and IT professionals (developers) to
  achieve the development of the software. The building of a shared culture/knowledge,
  or for the less of a mutual understanding and comprehensibility are the keys of
  the project success. In spring 2024, the Vitam 7.1 will be released. \n\nDuring
  this workshop, the Vitam team will present the organization of the program, and
  give an overview of the concepts, functionalities and roadmap of the Vitam software.
  There will also be a hands-on exercises, allowing attendees to familiarize themselves
  with the Vitam software, from records acquisition to access, archives lifecycle
  management and preservation.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.programmevitam.fr/pages/english/pres_english/\n
