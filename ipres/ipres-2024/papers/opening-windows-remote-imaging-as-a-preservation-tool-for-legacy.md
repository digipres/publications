abstract: The aim of this collaboration was to create a backup or safety copy of the
  media artwork "Three Windows - Hommage à Robert Lax" by Nicolas Humbert and Werner
  Penzel. This involved creating a disc image of the two SCSI hard drives installed
  in a Celsius Siemens 400 computer. To complement the in-house skills, the media
  conservation department of the Kunsthaus Zürich called upon the expertise of Tom
  Ensom and Robin François to benefit from their experience in disk imaging, legacy
  computing and Linux applications. After testing a combination of approaches and
  tools to image the drives, we used the Aaru Remote tool to remotely image the computer
  over a network connection. After backing up the hard drives, the original setup
  was tested and the computer was found to be functional. For the first time in 20
  years this original hardware could be documented and preparations made for ensuring
  the longevity of the artwork. Through this interdisciplinary collaboration, we have
  demonstrated the use of remote disk imaging, an approach that will have wider applications
  in digital preservation — particularly where physical access to storage media is
  difficult or obsolete interfaces are present.
