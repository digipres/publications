abstract: "The FAIRVault project is an interuniversity collaboration between four
  Flemish universities (Ghent University, Hasselt University, University of Antwerp,
  and Vrije Universiteit Brussel) that seeks to provide a generic solution to researchers
  from participating institutions for securely archiving and providing (controlled)
  access to research data in a FAIR-aligned way (FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable
  and Reusable) during the applicable data retention period, in particular in cases
  where deposit in one of the existing external data repositories is not/less appropriate
  or feasible (e.g. for sensitive data, large datasets, etc). \n\nThe goal is to implement
  a trustworthy and FAIR-enabling long-term preservation solution endorsed by research
  communities at partner institutions, implementing best practices certified by the
  CoreTrustSeal. Based on the confidentiality and sensitivity of the data suitable
  measures are taken to ensure information security. By doing so, valuable research
  data will not only be properly archived, but it will also unlock the potential for
  data sharing and effectively lead to a more efficient use of resources. It aims
  to fill the void for domains and/or use cases where existing solutions do not satisfy
  all needs in terms of e.g. security and the FAIR principles. \n\nThroughout the
  development of the FAIRVault we want to keep the expectations of divers stakeholders
  and entities in mind: (1) researchers, who bear the responsibility of ensuring the
  findability and accessibility of data over the medium to long term, even beyond
  the project funding periods, (2) institutions, both research and government, that
  aim to manage data assets in compliance with regulations, policies and contractual
  obligation, fostering openness and minimizing costs, (3)  data re-users, who seek
  transparent access processes, (4) the Flemish Government, that envisions stronger
  connections to the European Open Science Cloud, (5) FOSB/FRDN members, who seek
  cost effective solutions for Open Science KPI targets, (6) research funders, who
  prioritize  ethical and legal data management aligned with the FAIR principles,
  (7) the European Open Science Cloud, that aims to streamline research data infrastructure
  through interoperability principles and standards, and (8) other research institutions,
  given the aim to provide an operational service beyond the initial consortium."
