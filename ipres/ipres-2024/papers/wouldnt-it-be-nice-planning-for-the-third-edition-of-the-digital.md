abstract: "In the first quarter of 2024, the Digital Preservation Coalition undertook
  a scoping study to capture requirements from the digital preservation community
  for a forthcoming Third Edition of their cornerstone publication, The Digital Preservation
  Handbook. The study included a community survey, which received 150 responses, and
  a series of focus groups that included junior and senior practitioners, educators,
  managers, researchers, technologists, and policy makers. \n\nThe outcomes of this
  information gathering phase were used to define a set of guiding principles for
  the development of the Third Edition, and to help establish a proposal for the structure
  and content. These, in turn, have been included in a plan for creation of the Third
  Edition, which will be a significant, multi-year project.\n\nThe project is due
  to commence in August 2024, and during this lightning talk we will summarize the
  outcomes of the scoping study, share the guiding principles, and provide an update
  on plans and activities to date. We will also share how the community can engage
  with the development of this much loved and used resource."
