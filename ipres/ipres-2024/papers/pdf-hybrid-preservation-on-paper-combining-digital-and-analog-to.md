abstract: Many organizations preserve content in PDF form.  Andra, the French national
  radioactive waste management agency, documents its nuclear waste repositories mostly
  in this format, with a requirement to preserve some of this documentation over multi-century
  timescales at least.  The impermanence of computing and complexity of the PDF format
  make the latter inappropriate for such timescales, and Andra has consequently taken
  the route of printing these documents on permanent paper.  In the process however,
  in addition to the resulting high page count, digital integrity is lost which jeopardizes
  automated processing of text (e.g. search, translation, sorting) as it becomes dependent
  on the hypothetical future availability of perfect OCR.  To try and benefit from
  the best of both digital and analog, the Micr’Olonys solution from Eupalia, already
  tested at Andra on a database, was extended with a preparer utility, called Sumetar,
  to convert PDF files into plain UTF-8 encoded text files associated with images
  in the BMP format or printed in analog form.  Plain text and the BMP format are
  both very simple yet widespread, and are therefore suited for long term as well
  as current accessibility.  Sumetar packages multiple files into a single uncompressed
  tar file, another very simple format.  Micr’Olonys then transcribes the digital
  file into 2D barcodes printed on paper for passive preservation.  Tests carried
  out in late 2023 show that this strategy typically offers a four-fold reduction
  in page count for a document with roughly one image every two pages on average.
