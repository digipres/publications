abstract: 'The shift from document-centric to data-centric approaches in the research
  process presents new challenges and opportunities for long-term data preservation.
  This presentation addresses these issues by examining specific case studies below
  that illustrate the complexities and solutions in preserving data related to research
  activities. Additionally, it will discuss the growing focus on management practices,
  the establishment of institutional policies, and the development of project-specific
  Data Management Plans (DMPs).


  Digital Humanities Research Data: This involves preserving text analysis and visualization
  scripts, as well as copyrighted content used as source data. Focus points include
  how to preserve and pass down complex algorithms beyond mere data organization,
  handle the migration of outdated visualization scripts, and manage copyright issues,
  including permission applications.


  Linked Data and IIIF Data: This example covers databases and digital archives in
  the form of Linked Data and IIIF. In the background, we have original data in CSV
  format, transformed RDF/Turtle, and images, along with the scripts used for data
  organization and conversion. Key challenges include handling relatively large datasets,
  managing data that falls under institutional responsibility beyond individual researchers
  or projects, and preserving the history of data organization and interpretation
  despite the difficulties in drawing clear boundaries between them.


  Data related to research activities should include not only research outputs, processes,
  and underlying resources but also documents related to the administration of research
  communities. This approach ensures the transparency of research practices at the
  community level and conveys this transparency to future generations. As an example,
  I will introduce the translation of documents related to research integrity, highlighting
  the role of web archiving technology.


  To bridge generations of researchers, it is essential to develop methodologies that
  ensure the longevity and semantic consistency of preserved data. By exploring these
  case studies, we aim to identify the necessary steps and tools required to maintain
  the accessibility and interoperability of research data. Additionally, by considering
  the roles of projects and institutions, we can better ensure the successful transmission
  of data across generations, thus fostering a more collaborative and inclusive research
  environment.'
