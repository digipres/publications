abstract: "Digital preservation can best be approached and worked on within a community.
  A safe place where practitioners are nearby and where you can ask questions, put
  forward your experience, share knowledge and insights and work together on issues
  that are larger than life. But how do you form a community of practice in the first
  place and keep the community alive and thriving in your region. \n\nIf you wish
  to start or expand your existing local community of practice: be inspired by a few
  good practices, provided by members of the subcommittee Start2Preserve.\n\nCollaboration,
  knowledge sharing, and community-building are key. No expert knowledge required."
