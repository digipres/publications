abstract: 'Preservation Python is a snake-type game where the player controls a continually
  shrinking python, a metaphor for obsolescence and data loss. The python must ingest,
  pun intended, content and preservation information while avoiding elements that
  accelerate data loss. If the python survives a certain length of time, the required
  elements will change into preservation actions needed to maintain continued access.


  The game is meant to introduce the elements of an OAIS Archival Information Package
  to beginners in a fun and interactive way, as well as to present digital preservation
  as a continuous activity. The fast-paced nature of a snake game also encourages
  the player to make decisions on which elements they prefer to prioritise.


  The game is a product of the Bits and Bots study group (https://github.com/Lotte-W/Bits-and-Bots-study-group).'
