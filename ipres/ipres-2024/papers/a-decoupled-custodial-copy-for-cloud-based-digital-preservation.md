abstract: "Many archives are making use of cloud-based managed services for Digital
  Preservation and this can provide a pragmatic way of delivering the long-term storage
  and active management of digital records without reliance on in-house technical
  expertise and infrastructure.  But not all organisations are comfortable with fully
  outsourcing the responsibility for holding digital records, and may also worry about
  topics such as exit planning when moving to a new supplier or business continuity
  and disaster recovery in case of short or long-term issues with the cloud platform
  or provider.  Generally, some archives will be more comfortable if they also hold
  their own copy of their digital records in a form that can be read without need
  for proprietary systems or products. \n\nThe National Archives (UK) are making use
  of a cloud-based managed service for the actively managed and immediately accessible
  copy of their records but have also built a Custodial Copy system which automatically
  and immediately takes a copy of all records as they appear in the cloud-based system,
  and sends a copy to decoupled off-cloud storage.  These digital records wonâ€™t just
  be an IT backup of the cloud platform but will be stored in an product-agnostic
  standardised form, using the Oxford Common File Layout, and with each file accompanied
  by an up-to-date copy of all the metadata describing the record.  This Custodial
  Copy is intended to be a fully complete and self-describing representation of the
  digital archive which could be used as a source for future migrations or for access
  to these records outside of the cloud platform.  This poster will describe some
  of the challenges which have been encountered when designing and implementing this
  capability, and the solutions that have been developed to address these.  All the
  developed software is published on GitHub as Open Source and it is hoped that other
  archives will benefit from this work."
