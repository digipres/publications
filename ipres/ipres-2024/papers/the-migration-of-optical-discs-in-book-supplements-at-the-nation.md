abstract: 'The National Diet Library (NDL), as the only legal deposit library in Japan,
  is responsible for preserving its collections as cultural properties of the nation
  and passing them on to future generations. Regarding digital materials, the NDL
  has formulated the "Basic Plan for Digital Preservation of National Diet Library’s
  Collections for 2021-2025" and has been working on research and practice for digital
  preservation. The NDL is currently digitizing and migrating its collections, and
  as part of this process, a large-scale migration of about 10,000 optical discs was
  conducted in FY2023.

  The migration mainly targeted CDs of book supplements published in Japan up to the
  year 2000. The types of discs were diverse and included CD-ROMs that simply stored
  a few files, audio CDs, hybrid CDs, and relatively early DVD-Video (DVD players
  began to be produced in 1996), as well as optical discs containing large numbers
  of files with programs like databases.

  In order to migrate these diverse discs efficiently, we designed a workflow that
  classifies discs in advance and extracts data in a manner appropriate for each type
  of disc format. Optical discs were classified into three main categories: optical
  discs for simply copying files, for extracting audio tracks only, and for imaging
  in ISO format. It was confirmed that the method of imaging everything regardless
  of disc’s type was the most efficient for migration work, although there were many
  technical issues in searching and using the contents of image files.

  In addition, in this work, all optical discs were subjected to an error check equivalent
  to ISO/IEC 18630:2023 before the data extraction. As a result, it was confirmed
  that, especially for audio CDs, there was a correlation between high error values
  and noise in the migration results. Therefore, we found that the appropriate use
  of error check can improve the efficiency of quality inspection of audio CD migration.

  In this poster, we will report on the issues and propose an efficient technical
  method for the migration of various optical discs published more than a quarter
  of a century ago.'
