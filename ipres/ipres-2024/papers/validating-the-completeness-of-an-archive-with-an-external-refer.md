abstract: "Trustworthy repositories of archival data need to be reliable and ensure
  the authenticity of their holdings. However, one aspect that is not often addressed
  is the verification of the completeness of these holdings.\nWith this lightning
  talk, the Publications Office will share its experience on how it ensures that the
  collections it archives are complete.\nThe Publications Office of the EU is the
  central point of access to EU law, as well as to publications, open data, research
  results, procurement notices and other official information. It plays at the same
  time the roles of a publishing house, a legal depository and an archive for the
  publications authored by the EU institutions. Among its digital collections, the
  ‘Official Journal of the European Union’ occupies a central place, as the digital
  version is legally binding since July 2013, replacing the paper edition. It thus
  requires particular attention in terms of authenticity and completeness.\nUntil
  now, the control of the completeness was ensured by a list established at the entrance
  of the archive. The filenames and checksums of all the documents ingested in the
  long-term preservation repository are kept in a list that is regularly compared
  to the inventory of the assets contained in the repository, and to their index.
  This way, we check if all ingested documents are still present over time and after
  preservation actions such as migrations, media refreshes, etc.\nRecently, we made
  a significant change to our IT architecture by creating a reference list that is
  physically and conceptually separate from the archiving workflow. Most importantly,
  this list is fed at the entrance of the documents into the dissemination repository,
  i.e. at the moment where they are published (and not when they are archived). With
  this change, we can carry out a regular check that our archival assets are complete
  and intact, by comparing the filenames and checksums from the inventory to those
  of this new reference list. \nIn short, we have established a reference list that
  tells the archive what it SHOULD contain, and no longer simply what the archive
  has received."
