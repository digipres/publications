abstract: The shift from storage managed on-premises into the cloud has caused many
  digital preservation repository managers to reevaluate their approach to guaranteeing
  file integrity. Most cloud storage vendors offer guarantees of file durability that
  call into question the need for continuous fixity checking as often performed by
  repositories with file servers located on-premises. At the same time, cloud vendors
  tend to charge fees for bringing computational resources to bear on individual files,
  turning continuous fixity checking into a potentially burdensome expense. With these
  technical and business considerations in mind, this paper explores one institutionâ€™s
  solution to verifying fixity in a repository of approximately seventeen million
  files after transition from on-site to cloud storage. It evaluates broader considerations
  for the field of digital preservation when considering file integrity in the cloud
  and concludes with an explanation of a local policy for ongoing fixity monitoring
  adapted to the affordances of a cloud-adapted architecture.
