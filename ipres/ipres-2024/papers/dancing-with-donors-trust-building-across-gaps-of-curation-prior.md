abstract: 'Virginia Tech University Libraries (VTUL) serves a range of cultural heritage,
  academic, and local communities aligned in the goal to “get stuff online and accessible.”
  Despite the same overarching goal, the specific requirements from each party to
  reach that goal do not always overlap. The initial dance of negotiation between
  library and donor collaborations sets the tone for the ongoing relationship between
  the two. Across the departments in VTUL that manage such relationships with donors
  and curate digital collections, there are common trends emerging in barriers and
  observations with building relationships, and also with the concessions, compromises,
  and adjustments made to meet the curation needs of both parties. There are noted
  gaps in priorities and knowledge of curation processes, expectations around the
  understanding of digital collections, communication and roles and responsibilities,
  and resource understandability and availability. This paper specifically addresses
  relationships with donors and that impact on the subsequent work resulting from
  agreement with both parties.


  Continuing the iPRES conversation around community archiving and successful collaborations,
  the authors of this paper look critically at their partnerships with donors of digital
  material. This paper aligns with the conference theme “Start 2 preserve” in that
  it both addresses the barriers to entering the digital preservation landscape for
  the non-librarian community, and the barriers of digital preservation practitioners
  in aligning collaborator needs with digital curation needs. The authors focus on
  spotlighting the learning curve present on both sides of the work of community archiving.
  In recognizing recurrent gaps in understanding, this paper aims to be a part of
  a larger conversation on how community partnerships can blossom with built trust
  and understanding, coupled with robust planning and technical capability.'
