abstract: 'Arkive is the project for the creation of an infrastructure for long-term
  digital archiving of the Università degli Studi di Milano (UNIMI). The project design
  was based on OAIS and aims to provide an agnostic infrastructure (suitable for any
  type of digital object) for the long-term preservation of every digital object created
  by the UNIMI: data from research and - in the future - cultural assets, and administrative
  documents.

  Arkive has a modular infrastructure:

  1.            The storage system is based on Swarm Datacore cloud technology (S3).
  Despite it is usually addressed to cloud storage we chose to maintain the infrastructure
  on servers owned by university network. This way, there are better guarantees regarding
  data control from both security and data protection perspectives.

  2.            The file system is virtualized through iRODS, making it possible to
  completely replace the storage (or its parts), both in terms of hardware and technologies,
  without impacting the archive''s structure.

  3.            The data management "engine" is Archivematica, which allows for the
  analysis, normalization, packaging, and movement of data into the repository. aTOM
  is the application currently serving as the archive''s catalog/OPAC for its public
  part.

  4.            User access is permitted in read/write mode only in the data transfer
  zone and can occur through various methods: client, web page, command line, etc.
  Some of these methods provide advanced functionalities for transferring large amounts
  of data.

  This approach allows for the construction of solutions highly customized considering
  UNIMI structure and possible economic constraints and thus facilitating the long-term
  sustainability of this type of activity.

  As the project developed, it became clear that Arkive is just one of several centralized
  facilities for research data management at UNIMI, alongside other platforms like
  Dataverse and Indaco (the UNIMI’s High-Performance Computing infrastructure). To
  overcome fragmentation, efforts are underway to integrate these services into a
  digital ecosystem for research data management.

  The ultimate goal is to create a unified personal workspace environment that integrates
  all research-related services provided by the UNIMI.'
