abstract: "The Digital Archive team at University of Glasgow Archives & Special Collections
  (ASC) have now completed work on establishing ASC's born-digital asset register
  and intend to share with the digital preservation community our methods and lessons
  learned.  \n\nWe will share the practical processes that we used to identify and
  gather information on the born-digital assets in ASC’s collections and some of the
  questions that we asked ourselves to establish what we needed to record in the register.
  \ This includes how we went about finding digital material in our processed and
  unprocessed collections, recording and checking locations for the material, as well
  as logging and checking physical storage media to record its condition.\n\nWe intend
  to detail the work that went into developing the asset register itself using Microsoft
  Lists and other Office 365 tools and sharing the decision making around settling
  on these tools and how they fit in with our institution’s information technology
  support.\n\nThe digital asset register has been integrated with our digital archiving
  logs, another tool developed in-house, allowing us to log digital preservation actions
  against each asset in the register.  This will be touched upon as well as sharing
  our methods for the ongoing work to identify and add digitised material to the register.\n\nIt
  is our hope that by sharing our methods we can provide some tips and support others
  who are developing their own digital asset registers as well as inviting discussion
  with others sharing their own registers to see where we can improve our own."
