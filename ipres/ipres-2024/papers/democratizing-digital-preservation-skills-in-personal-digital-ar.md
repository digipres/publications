abstract: "Over the last decade there has been a notable shift toward improving digital
  preservation skill capacities of collecting institutions staff in the United Kingdom.
  The DPC/TNA Novice to Know-How course and its ongoing development is a salient example.
  This poster uses interactive and asynchronous engagement to call on digital preservation
  community educators and policymakers to include individuals and community groups
  when developing “start 2 preserve” initiatives. This poster’s call is supported
  with empirical findings that contribute to the emerging issue of democratizing digital
  preservation skills amongst these groups in the UK. \n\nUsing in-poster links to
  audiovisual evidence, the poster presents findings from two doctoral, qualitative,
  research projects. One project researched self-tracking personal digital archives,
  and the other researched activist community web archives. The first project used
  mobile and virtual data collection methods, researching eight members of the public
  who used self-tracking records to create personal digital archives of their running
  history. The second project used interviews and participant diaries to understand
  the engagement of UK activist-archives with web archiving also including data from
  Documenting the Now, the UK Web Archive and the Community Archives and Heritage
  Group. \n\nThe poster discusses the findings in relation to the need to democratize
  digital preservation skills. Activist archives recognise the need for digital preservation
  skills but there is a skills gap for runners' personal digital archives. Runners
  often lack digital preservation knowledge and rely on third-party platforms. Both
  studies highlighted the need to empower individuals and activist communities to
  preserve digital content beyond commercial platforms through educational resources
  and capacity building. Empowerment through democratized digital preservation education
  could enable individuals and activist communities to make informed choices about
  their digital legacies and respect their agency to contribute to safeguarding further
  a shared digital heritage for future generations. \n\nThis poster, with asynchronous
  digital learning tools, provides new knowledge about the digital preservation skills
  from the UK public and activist community groups. The poster wants to open a conversation
  with the international digital preservation community to help those wanting to get
  started with digital preservation to meet their personal and community digital archive
  needs."
