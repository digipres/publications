abstract: Digital Preservation refers to the series of managed activities necessary
  to ensure continued access to digital materials for as long as necessary, which
  has garnered widespread attention from institutions and individuals and has undergone
  extensive research. This study constructs a literature dataset based on Web of Science
  and Scopus, and applies the BERTopic model to identify themes and analyze development
  trends in the literature. The results show that research themes in digital preservation
  mainly include cultural heritage preservation and related technologies, data preservation,
  metadata and models, risk assessment and management, personal information, and website
  preservation, with libraries remaining key participants in digital preservation.
  The overall popularity of various research topics exhibits a fluctuating yet stable
  state, with research on cultural heritage preservation technologies such as 3D and
  laser showing an initial peak followed by a decline, while research on data preservation
  has been a consistent hotspot since 2009, albeit showing a downward trend in recent
  years. With the development of large language models, the importance of data has
  been elevated to unprecedented levels, and data preservation is poised to enter
  a new peak of research.
