abstract: 'File format identification is generally accepted as a key digital preservation
  activity as it enables preservation practitioners to understand, manage, and mitigate
  format-related risks and challenges.


  File format identification tools such as DROID and Siegfried use multiple methods
  to identify file formats, including by extension, by binary signature, and by container
  signature.


  Previous iPres workshops (2018, 2022) have tackled binary signature patterns for
  file format identification. This interactive workshop will build upon these previous
  workshops and will explore container-based file format identification and container
  signatures.


  The workshop will help participants gain practical skills in the analysis of complex
  digital files. There will be a brief recap on binary signatures for file format
  identification, making this workshop accessible for beginners and experienced practitioners
  and allowing attendees to become familiar with the workshop themes.


  Participants will learn about the various structures of file formats, with a particular
  emphasis on multi-part formats, and how container signatures are used to identify
  many of these format types. Tools such as hex editors and file packaging utilities
  will be demonstrated and used to explore these file formats in more detail.


  Participants will learn to recognize the indicators of candidate formats for container
  signature identification, and will gain an understanding of the structure and syntax
  of container signatures as used by tools such as DROID and Siegfried.


  The workshop will cover research techniques for harvesting file format samples and
  format specifications that are used to verify findings.


  Finally, participants will get hands-on with tools for creating and testing container
  signatures, and will gain familiarity with the process for submitting their file
  format research to the PRONOM team.


  Experienced instructors will be on hand throughout the session to assist with the
  workshop activities and answer any questions.'
