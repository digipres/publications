abstract: '[Purpose/Significance] Since 2013, the National Digital Preservation Center
  (hereafter referred to as NDPC) led by the National Science and Technology Library
  has made important achievements. To accelerate the long-term preservation of national
  digital science and technology resources, it is necessary to analyze the overall
  long-term preservation of resources and propose some development suggestions to
  achieve the goal of fully implementing safe and reliable long-term preservation
  of important foreign digital science and technology resources in China. [Methods/Process]
  This paper analyzes the preserved resources of the NDPC from different dimensions,
  reviews the current problems and proposes development suggestions. [Results/Conclusion]
  The long-term preservation of digital science and technology resources involves
  content type, preservation scope, subject scope, etc. It is necessary to accelerate
  the long-term preservation of national digital science and technology resources
  by strengthening negotiations on resource rights, expanding preservation institutions,
  planning and adjusting preservation objectives, and promoting the implementation
  of entrusted preservation.'
