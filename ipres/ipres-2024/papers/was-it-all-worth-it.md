abstract: "iPRES has been around for a while. It’s now 20 years since the first iPRES
  in Beijing and in that time we’ve seen a lot of people stand up in front of their
  peers and talk about digital preservation and closely related subjects. Close to
  1200 contributions have been recorded in the published proceedings since that first
  event. My colleagues and I have been wondering for a while if we’ve made a difference
  to the world of Digital Preservation as a result. Within those 1200 or so contributions
  were there ideas that have stood the test of time, become main stream. In short,
  was it all worth it?\nThanks to Andrew Jackson of the DPC (and in the nick of time
  for this poster) we can now see all the conference proceedings in one place—https://www.digipres.org/publications/—and
  we can play around with the underlying metadata! Hooray! \nThis poster (and the
  associated lightning talk) is intended to show an initial exploration and analysis
  of the outputs of the iPRES conferences with a view to undertaking a deeper analysis
  and paper for a future iPRES."
