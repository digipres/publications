abstract: Digital preservation policies can be interpreted as a link between the dimensions
  of a preservation ecosystem and digital preservation management. Regarding institutional
  repositories, the guarantee of the longevity of digital content is most often weakened
  by the lack of this documentation. Therefore, we understand that Distributed Digital
  Preservation is a reliable alternative to mitigating the lack of policies and other
  risk agents. This paper presents an overview of digital preservation policies in
  institutional repositories of the LOCKSS networks community. This article identified
  the structure and grip of digital preservation policies to ISO 14721 and 16363 standards
  guidelines. Eleven LOCKSS networks were identified, 610 partner institutions were
  investigated, resulting in the identification of 184 institutional repositories
  and 40 digital preservation policy documents. Digital Preservation Policy is an
  essential document so that the promise of guaranteeing the longevity of digital
  objects stored in the Institutional Repository can be fulfilled. In this context,
  using the framework structure for digital preservation policies, identified on the
  websites of institutions in the LOCKSS networks, expands the scope of the domain
  of managing the preservation of digital content in Institutional Repositories.
