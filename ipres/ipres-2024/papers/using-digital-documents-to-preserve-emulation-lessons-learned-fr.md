abstract: 'What started as a request for emulation-related readings to share with
  graduate students for a guest lecture quickly ballooned into a side project with
  a life of its own. Since 2021, I have personally maintained and grown a public Zotero
  bibliography of professional literature on the topic of emulation as a technological
  practice for digital preservation â€“ a collection of citations and links that now
  includes references for about 200 conference papers (many of them from iPRES), journal
  articles, white papers, grant reports, books, blog posts, and more, published over
  a 30-year period stretching from (currently) 1992 to the present.

  With this lightning talk, I hope to expand awareness and usage of this corpus for
  a key purpose: a better shared understanding of the history of our field and its
  practice. While this emulation bibliography provides vital resources for students
  and new professionals to build their skills and catch up on a robust area of technological
  research and development (and within itself containing micro-trends on potential
  sub-topics: emulation tooling, linked open data for emulation, emulation for archival
  access, emulation for curation, etc.), it also presents an opportunity for reflection
  for more seasoned practitioners: how far have we actually come over 30 years? What
  patterns have emerged in our writing, theory, and use cases for emulation? Are there
  gaps between the written record and actual lived experience of the field and its
  implemented practice? These are bigger questions than I can answer in the course
  of 5 minutes, but by simultaneously posing them and pointing to the means to engage
  further, I hope this lightning talk would also lay the groundwork for a more in-depth
  literature review or paper on the history of emulation practice in digital preservation
  at a future conference.'
