abstract: "Many iPRES papers often receive relatively few citations, indicating low
  levels of re-use. Whilst these low levels of usage cannot be attributed to a single
  reason, inconsistent approaches to sharing, publishing, and describing papers over
  the past twenty years have not helped. This poster goes some way to explore a solution
  for more consistent description of papers, facilitating their findability and thus
  their potential for re-usability, by proposing a controlled vocabulary for iPRES
  submissions. \n\nA controlled vocabulary for iPRES papers was used in the early
  days of iPRES, namely the ACM set of classification codes. This however had limited
  specificity relevant to most iPRES submissions and was later abandoned. The current
  'anything goes' approach enables greater specificity but results in more variation
  across the corpus as a whole: the problem has escalated from insufficient choice
  to too much choice. Search the iPRES keywords index produced for the DPC Registries
  of Good Practice, for example, and it suggests over a thousand different entries.
  The phrase 'needle in a haystack' comes to mind, especially problematic for not
  only early careerists and researchers but also practitioners with limited amounts
  of time but urgent business problems to address.\n\nThis poster proposes a controlled
  set of keywords as a first step towards improving consistent classification, findability
  and subsequently re-usability of our field's knowledge. The core structure is provided
  by the high level entities from the CHARM domain model on digital preservation risk.
  These identify at a consistently granular level the main aspects of the digital
  preservation domain (e.g. legal; policy; strategy; system software; network; metadata;
  content) and target values (e.g. authenticity; integrity; retrievability). These
  are supplemented by a cross referencing and subsequent merging of the top 30 (or
  so) keywords identified by the Good Practice project, and finally a gap analysis
  by the authors to identify and propose additional terms for areas that are possibly
  under-represented. Pending discussion with the community during iPRES and subsequent
  refinement of terms, the results (along with a user guide to facilitate consistent
  implementation) will be suggested to the iPRES steering group as a proposal for
  future events."
