abstract: "Five years on from iPres2019, our focus then on rescue, six additional
  Keepers now report in to extend the reach of the Keepers Registry: the Internet
  Archive, Merritt Preservation Repository (California) and the national libraries
  of France and Spain, plus Cariniana Network (Brazil) and ZBW (Leibniz, Germany).
  They join others, such as Portico, CLOCKSS, Global LOCKSS Network, PKP-PLN, KB (Netherlands),
  Library of Congress, Scholars Portal and HathiTrust.\n\nDisclosure by archiving
  organisations on the details of content they preserve, and how, enables the Keepers
  Registry to act as the global monitor of what online continuous resources are safe
  on digital shelves. That also allows analysis of the aggregated metadata held in
  the ISSN Portal to shine a light what is unknown and at risk of loss. \n\nWe report
  details of progress for scholarly journals from the 'Big Publishers', the approach
  being taken for OA content and share statistical evidence on the high rates of unknown
  archival status for scholarly works from specific countries, some surprising. \n\nThere
  are strategic choices to be made. What do you advise? Prioritise the product of
  scholarship or change tack and try to ensure that what is issued online around the
  world is kept as published heritage. The latter requires request to national libraries
  that they declare what content is actually being kept safe."
