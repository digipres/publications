abstract: "Globally, conflicts and wars threaten sustainability of peopleâ€™s tangible
  and intangible heritage. Traditional Circumcision (kaja) practice and ceremony which
  is a cultural heritage of the Kanuri people of Northeastern Nigeria is a rite of
  passage for young boys into adulthood. Presently, this practice stands the risk
  of fading away completely due to the mass displacement resulting from the Boko Haram
  conflict. The affected indigenous Kanuri communities are on the verge of loosing
  their sense of place and opportunity to express their cultural values and traditional
  knowledge. Currently we have tried to use various social media platforms through
  Communities of Practice to bring elders together and the youth in order to capture
  and pass this knowledge to the current and future generations. Despite these little
  efforts, lack of sustainable digital technologies to preserve and ensure accessibility
  of this knowledge, endangers the knowledge of Kaja. Therefore, there is the urgent
  need for digital preservation of these practices to salvage the situation before
  it is too late. \n\nThe traditional circumcision is seen as the foundation for fostering
  lifetime unity and brotherhood amongst boys. This practice is associated with social
  cohesion of boys of the same age who become circumcised at the same time.\nThrough
  this rite, young boys are taught peacebuilding and how to live in harmony with other
  communities\nThe rites performed serves as a prayer for unhindered success for the
  boys throughout their lifetime.\n\n\nAlthough there are several changes witnessed
  over the years due to modernisation and the recent insurgency, the study found that
  the core philosophy has remained intact at least within the elders. This knowledge
  can however die with these elders if concrete actions are not taken to preserve
  them. It is imperative to digitally preserve these knowledges and performances to
  make them accessible to displaced Kanuri people and the future generations."
