abstract: 'The Digital Preservation Storage Criteria Working Group would like to share
  a revision of the Digital Preservation Storage Criteria Game, first played at iPRES
  2018. Players will learn about the Criteria (preservation storage considerations
  for digital material), consider how they are important in different contexts, and
  practice explaining why theyâ€™re important in their context.

  This version has new and revised Criteria cards, based on recent work to map the
  Criteria to relevant international digital preservation and information technology
  standards, and feedback from the Working Group''s workshop at iPres 2023.'
