abstract: DIMAG is a software suite developed jointly by a cooperative of German-speaking
  archives. It is composed of several ingest and pre-ingest tools for different kinds
  of content and aspects, a core module and an access module. In this landscape, the
  DIMAG Ingest Process Module ensures the central processing, control and management
  of ingest packages of digital objects of all kinds. It ensures a strong audit trail
  on what was executed, especially selection and deletion during the process. Depending
  on the challenges posed by the Bake-Off and on DIMAG's availabilities, other modules
  might form part of the demo.
