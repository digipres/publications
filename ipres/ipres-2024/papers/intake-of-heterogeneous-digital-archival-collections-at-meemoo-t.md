abstract: 'Letâ€™s talk about the **challenges** we encounter at meemoo, the Flemish
  Institute for Archives, regarding the **intake of heterogeneous digital archival
  collections**. More than 180 Flemish cultural heritage, governmental and broadcasting
  organisations entrust their digital archives to meemoo in a partnership (our content
  partners).  These digitised or born digital archives derive from various sources,
  are very heterogeneous, consist of multiple (sometimes new or exotic) formats and
  contain more often than not complex digital objects. An extra challenge is the sometimes
  limited capacity and digital maturity  within these organisations.


  **How can we organise the intake of these diverse digitised or digital born archives
  into the MAM of meemoo in an efficient, user-friendly and affordable way?** We were
  in need of a new and improved process for this digital intake which could tackle
  the above mentioned challenges. In this lightning talk, I would like to present
  the steps we took, like functional and technical analysis, internal brainstorms,
  focus talks with our content partners, implementing the E-ARK SIP, etc., and the
  outcomes. We were particularly looking for a solution regarding the pre-ingest processes,
  for example cleaning, selecting and structuring the data by our content partners,
  and the creation of E-ARK compliant  SIPs.


  To conclude, I will present some **lessons learned**, give a **status update** (where
  are we now) and say something about the **next steps** (where do we want to be).
  By September, we will be a lot further than we are now, but I can already say that
  we will certainly develop **tooling** for the creation and validation of E-ARK SIPs.


  I would afterwards love to hear from fellow participants about their experiences
  and lessons learned regarding the intake of heterogeneous digital archival collections!'
