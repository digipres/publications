abstract: 'Nowadays, Rescuing valuable historical data from legacy systems is an important
  challenge in digital transformation. Long-term negative maintenance of legacy systems
  threatens the security and availability of historical data, and also brings economic
  and technical burdens. In the Chinese context, this article first concludes the
  requirements triangle which means the public sectors'' need to rescue historical
  data of legacy systems lies in three aspects: data long-term preservation, data
  used as evidence and data sharing and utilization. Based on a review of the relevant
  literature, this paper categorizes the existing approaches related to legacy systems
  into a two-dimensional matrix with four quadrants according to the degree of technological
  and functional change. Building on these approaches, and in order to further meet
  the requirements triangle, this article suggests a Chinese solution - data archiving,
  which is based on China''s institutional background and archive management demands.
  Data archiving incorporates the comprehensive archives into the process of solving
  legacy system problems, takes advantage of the expertise of archives in long-term
  preservation of resources, and finally satisfies the requirements triangle. It can
  be concluded that the practice of data archiving simultaneously brings value to
  organizations plagued by legacy systems, to comprehensive archives and to the data
  itself.'
