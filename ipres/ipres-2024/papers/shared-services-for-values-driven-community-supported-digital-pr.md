abstract: "Community-supported, values-driven digital preservation services operate
  in a landscape where the increasing economic, labor, and climate challenges are
  too big for any one organization to tackle alone. \n\nIn the context of these challenges,
  the Educopia Institute—in partnership with APTrust, Chronopolis, CLOCKSS, lyrasis,
  MetaArchive, and the Texas Digital Library (six members of the Digital Preservation
  Services Collaborative)—sought funding from the Institute of Library and Museum
  Services (IMLS) to reaffirm the need for—and to establish a shared vision for—the
  sustained viability of values-driven, community-supported approaches to distributed
  digital preservation (DDP). \n\nAs the project advanced we were reminded that, as
  technical service providers, we too are embedded in a broader cultural context that
  is unconsciously biased towards technocentric solutions, or solutions that foreground
  technological infrastructures and background social infrastructures. Acknowledging
  that there are technical and non-technical requirements across the information management
  continuum, our shared service model vision aims to offer two additional services
  at discrete moments in the institutional decision-making process: “advocacy-as-a-service,”
  best deployed at the institutional preservation strategy-forming moment; and “readiness-as-a-service,”
  assisting stewardship organizations that have recently formed their preservation
  strategy to identify the content, preservation needs, budget realities, etc., as
  they begin to research the digital preservation services landscape.\n\nBeyond individual
  organizations, readiness-as-a-service is also a call for collective strategy among
  values-driven, community-supported bit-level service providers to anticipate and
  be prepared to respond to change (and to shocks) in a nimble, coordinated, collaborative
  way.\n\nWe think this vision offers an exciting and viable path forward for values-driven,
  community-supported service providers, and we hope this vision will attract additional
  service providers and grow our coalition of support."
