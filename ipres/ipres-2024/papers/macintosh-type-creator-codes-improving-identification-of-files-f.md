abstract: Working with Macintosh files from the 1980 to early 2000’s can be challenging
  as they are often on difficult to access disks, unique encoding, have resource forks,
  and often don’t use extensions. Identification of files from a Macintosh formatted
  disk can be accomplished with identification methods such as PRONOM, but what if
  those standard methods come up empty or are misleading? This paper investigates
  a method of identification which can provide better results compared to existing
  methods. The Macintosh operating system used special extended attribute codes to
  not only identify the file type, but also the original creating application. Called
  Type / Creator codes, these extended attributes are often lost or hidden to the
  user during preservation activities but can provide important information for long
  term preservation. These codes along with resource forks can provide necessary information
  for emulation and migration activities.
