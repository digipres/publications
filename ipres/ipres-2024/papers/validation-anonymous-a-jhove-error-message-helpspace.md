abstract: "JHOVE is one of the most widely used tools in digital preservation. Those
  familiar, will know the number of error messages it reports. Currently, JHOVE supports
  different types of messages, ranging from error messages for validation failures
  which can indicate a problem with the file, to info messages covering everything
  else, e.g. too many PDF fonts for reporting. Even validation errors are varied,
  especially for complex file formats. In this workshop, the presenters will lend
  their considerable JHOVE experience to help users to analyse JHOVE error messages
  and diagnose problems in affected files.\n\nThe session targets beginners and practitioners.
  No experience in file format analysis is required of attendees. Before the workshop,
  we will circulate installation instructions and ask participants to bring examples
  of problematic files. This will allow participants to work with data and problems
  that feel familiar to them.\n\nWe will begin with a twenty-minute introductory session
  to JHOVE and its standard modules. We will then discuss the error message reports
  in more detail: how to interpret JHOVE messages and demonstrate the use of standard
  tools, like hex viewers/editors, file format standards and other file format analysis
  tools to find the location of errors in problematic files.  \n\nThe second part
  of the workshop will be hands-on, dividing the participants into small breakout
  groups. We will employ the techniques covered earlier to try to understand real-world
  error messages/file problems, using their own data or data provided by the facilitators.
  The presenters will moderate and assist up to three groups each, including online
  breakout rooms, during which we plan to engage both remote and onsite participants.
  \n\nThere will then be a twenty-minute session to discuss the groupsâ€™ experiences.
  Attendees will be encouraged to report their successes and failures, as well as
  provide feedback as to how JHOVE reporting might be improved. We will conclude with
  a ten-minute session to debrief. While this can comfortably fit in an hour and a
  half, it could also be extended if needed. \n\nThe minimum number of attendees would
  be twelve to fifteen people, but we can accommodate up to forty for this session."
