abstract: 'In the evolving landscape of heritage and preservation, the transition
  from traditional documentation to dynamic data ecosystems is redefining the way
  organizations operate. As we traverse this paradigm shift, the integration of ontologies
  emerges as a pivotal mechanism for streamlining processes, enhancing collaboration,
  and preserving cultural legacies.

  Our proposed discussion panel, titled " Ontologies in the real world: How to make
  things happen?", seeks to delve into the practical applications and challenges of
  implementing ontological frameworks within the broadcasting and heritage domains.
  Drawing upon real-world experiences and insights, our panelists will address a spectrum
  of key topics:


  **Overcoming Implementation Hurdles**: We''ll explore the complexities inherent
  in introducing ontologies within established suborganizations, navigating resistance
  to change, and fostering a culture of adaptability amidst differing operational
  methodologies.


  **Documenting for Clarity**: Discussants will dissect the nuances of effectively
  documenting ontologies to mitigate misunderstandings, ensure coherence, and facilitate
  seamless knowledge transfer across diverse stakeholders.


  **Forging Interconnections**: Delving into the intricacies of linking disparate
  ontologies, our panelists will elucidate strategies for harmonizing vocabularies
  and bridging conceptual gaps, particularly between broadcasting assets and heritage
  artifacts.


  **Striking the Balance of Detail**: Finding the optimal level of granularity within
  ontological frameworks poses a significant challenge. Through case studies and best
  practices, we''ll navigate the delicate balance between comprehensiveness and usability.


  **Empowering Collaboration**: Examining the decision to permit or restrict partner
  organizations from crafting their own ontology subclasses, our discourse will uncover
  the implications for interoperability, data integrity, and collaborative innovation.


  Through a blend of theoretical discourse and practical insights, our panel endeavors
  to equip attendees with actionable strategies, frameworks, and perspectives for
  navigating the multifaceted terrain of ontologies in the broadcasting and heritage
  sectors. Join us as we unravel the complexities of ontological integration and chart
  a course toward effective knowledge management and preservation in the digital age.
