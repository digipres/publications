abstract: The Digital Preservation Coalition’s community survey on mental health and
  wellbeing has illuminated a number of worrying trends. These include 70% of respondents
  having to work to unrealistic expectations, 63% feeling overwhelmed by the advocacy
  burden of digital preservation, and 58% feeling unsupported in their work. Linked
  to these problems and more, 88% reported work related stress, 69% anxiety, 67% fatigue,
  and 59% burnout, as well as a range of other issues. In this session, to be held
  under Chatham House Rule, iPRES attendees are invited to discuss the issues we are
  experiencing as a profession and how we might take steps to address them.
