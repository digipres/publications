abstract: The need to preserve microcomputer software as part of our shared digital
  heritage is now recognised. This work is being undertaken within academic and cultural
  institutions and also by the public. Some of this heritage exists on cassette tapes
  upon which data is encoded as sound. Current preservation practices implicitly privilege
  the preservation of the bytes encoded on the tape but not necessarily the original
  audio signal itself. This case study of Australian educational programs recovered
  from 40 year old cassettes suggests that their original signals contain evidence
  of an atypical mastering process and in doing so exemplify Kirschenbaum’s (2008)
  delineation between the forensic and formal materiality of digital objects. By extending
  this delineation, for the first time, to software on cassette this article attests
  to the ongoing theoretical value of Kirschenbaum’s thesis. It further suggests that
  cassette software preservation practices be aligned with those of physical object
  conservation in which an ethical responsibility to preserve ‘evidence of manufacture’
  has long been acknowledged.
