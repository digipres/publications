abstract: The Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC) is undertaking an analysis of digital
  preservation labor market data gathered from online job postings published between
  January 2021 to December 2022. This poster is intended to present the key findings
  from this analysis and introduce emerging themes or trends relating to different
  digital preservation role types. This will include job titles, salaries, contract
  durations, and consideration of how the descriptions of skill and knowledge requirements
  relate to the DPC's Digital Preservation Competency Framework. It will also introduce
  a final report and open dataset to invite further discussion and practical use by
  digital preservation practitioners.
