abstract: "This ‘Birds of a Feather’ session is designed to build momentum for the
  forthcoming ‘call for hosts’. The current iPRES schedule takes us to Wellington
  in 2025 and to Copenhagen in 2026. The iPRES Steering Group is therefore shortly
  going to call for hosts in 2027, 2028 and 2029 and with options for 2030 and 2031.
  \n\nThis session provides an opportunity for previous hosts to share their experience
  and gives prospective hosts a chance to discuss and explore themes with them. It
  will enable delegates at the conference to help shape the forthcoming call, ensuring
  iPRES is in safe hands long into its third decade. All are welcome!"
