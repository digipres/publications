abstract: 'Originally developed as a replacement to WinHelp in the late-90â€™s and still
  technically readable in a modern Windows system, the Microsoft Compiled HTML Help
  (CHM) file format is now generally considered to be a potential cybersecurity risk
  and organizational cybersecurity policies may prevent native execution through Windows.


  Alternative CHM readers exist but as they are largely based on reverse-engineering
  efforts, there may be subtleties to the format that have yet to be revealed and
  may result in imperfect or failed attempts to read some CHM file instances.


  In this lightning talk we take a quick dive into the structure of the CHM file format.
  We will explore a specific edge-case that prevented correct reading of some instances
  of the file format through open-source tooling and we will describe how this was
  corrected for the betterment of all.'
