abstract: "FIAT/IFTA is a global network for those engaged in the preservation and
  exploitation of audiovisual archives. \nOne of its entities is the Preservation
  and Migration Commission (PMC), which deals with aspects related to the preservation
  and migration of any audiovisual content from a long-time perspective when it comes
  to: Analogue and Digital Preservation Processes, Migration to Digital, Long-term
  Digital Preservation, Digital Restoration and Quality improvement, File Formats
  and Standards.\nA delegation of PMC members will propose a half-a-day workshop during
  which we can compare our strategies and cases with other members of the iPres global
  digital preservation community.\nAudio-visual content may be seen as any other type
  of document, however it has specific properties and preservation issues. First,
  for analogue and non-file-based formats, migration is definitely a need, a “one
  best chance” to do it properly while catching all possible errors, in order to produce
  preservation-quality content.\nIn the digital domain, audio-visual content requires
  a lot of storage, and preservation has to deal with the increasing number of file
  formats and with demanding access modalities when integrating archives with production
  and communication to the public.\nAlso, audio-visual content is often complemented
  and referenced by other types of documents (i.e. ancillary elements and data).\nOnce
  the basics and the most common strategies for migration and digital preservation
  are explained, a number of practical cases are going to be presented, which will
  offer an opportunity to interact with the audience. What would have been your choice
  of strategy, if it was your case? \nThe discussion will cover the nature of the
  audio-visual SIP; how to validate it; how to meet quality expectations; how many
  copies are needed to ensure preservation; how to maintain data integrity; how to
  document provenance; etc…"
