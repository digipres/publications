abstract: 'One of the three underlying themes of this years iPRES is “Starting to
  preserve”. Various groups amongst the organisers have for many months been discussing
  and planning how this might manifest itself at the conference... and beyond. Early
  in in the discussions it became apparent that there was a strong desire to leave
  a lasting legacy in the region, a digital preservation community of practice to
  keep fanning the flame of digital presentation interest that (hopefully) would be
  ignited through localised activities at the conference.


  Discussions around how this might be achieved have exposed hitherto unexpected (or
  at least unsurfaced) problems that would need to be overcome. Problems such as who
  exactly would the target audience be; how could they be reached; how we could make
  the case for digital preservation to them when they may not even realise that they
  had a problem; how could we get them to attend the proposed sessions at the conference;
  how could they afford to attend; and, perhaps most importantly, what steps would
  need to be taken to ensure a community of practice didn’t wither and die post conference.


  Luckily, the collective iPRES brain has been able to come up with some answers to
  some of these questions. We would like to pass on these learnings to the community.
  This lightning talk (and accompanying poster) outlines the problems we have encountered
  and the (potential) solutions we will be employing to achieve the stated aim of
  leaving an iPRES legacy behind us.'
