abstract: "In this panel discussion, we will share the experiences and outputs from
  a working group of libraries, publishers, and intermediaries convened by CLOCKSS
  in 2023. The group identified several barriers that prevent more books from being
  deposited in digital archives. We then focused on finding or building ways to overcome
  these challenges, engaging a wide array of key stakeholders along the way.\n\nOur
  terms of reference were to:\n\n 1. Produce some short, clear guidance for publishers
  about steps they can take to facilitate digital preservation of books and related
  metadata\n \n 2. Inform the development of the EPUB/A (A=archival) standard\n\n
  3. Improve discovery of which books are preserved where\n\nAll three strands have
  moved forward very successfully. We launched a digital preservation guide for publishers
  in March 2024 (https://clockss.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Clockss_Guide_WEB.pdf),
  ISO is moving the draft EPUB/A specification through its committee process with
  the goal of publishing it in draft form by the end of 2024, and an exciting Proof
  of Concept project has made it possible for publishers to use MARC and ONIX metadata
  to communicate where their books are preserved. An industry-wide international education
  campaign is just starting, and we will be able to report on this at the time of
  the iPres conference.\n\nWe'll have a mixed panel of librarians, preservationists,
  publishers, and intermediaries to share why they got engaged and what worked and
  didn't. There were some fascinating learning points for all, made possible by listening
  and engaging respectfully from a wide variety of perspectives."
