abstract: "The workshop aims to familiarize participants with the E-ARK specifications
  of information packages (CSIP, SIP, AIP, DIP) and Content Information Type Specifications
  (CITS), demonstrate the usage of E-ARK conformant validation tools (commons-ip and
  eark-validator), outline the steps to acquire the eArchiving Conformance Seal, and
  explore related fields such as digital signatures, data spaces, and artificial intelligence.\n\n**The
  agenda of the workshop:**\n\n - Introduction to E-ARK Information Packages: Overview
  of the E-ARK specifications: CSIP, SIP, AIP, DIP, Understanding Content Information
  Type Specifications (CITS)\n - Use cases and user experiences from Meemoo. \n -
  Validation Tools Demonstration: Hands-on demonstration of commons-ip and eark-validator,
  Step-by-step guide on how to validate information packages using these tools\n -
  Acquiring the eArchiving Conformance Seal: Overview of the eArchiving Conformance
  Seal and its significance, Detailed steps to ensure compliance with E-ARK specifications,
  Strategies for successful application and acquisition of the seal\n - Exploration
  of Related Fields:Digital Signatures: Importance, Implementation, and implications
  for information packages, Data Spaces: Understanding data storage and retrieval
  mechanisms in the digital age,         Artificial Intelligence: Integration of AI
  technologies in archival processes and preservation strategies\n - Interactive Discussions
  and Q&A Session: Participants are encouraged to share experiences, challenges, and
  insights, Facilitated Q&A session to address queries and concerns\n\n**Expected
  Outcomes:**\n\n - Participants will gain a comprehensive understanding of E-ARK
  specifications and information packages.\n - Hands-on experience with validation
  tools will enable participants to effectively validate information packages.\n -
  Clear guidance on acquiring the eArchiving Conformance Seal will empower participants
