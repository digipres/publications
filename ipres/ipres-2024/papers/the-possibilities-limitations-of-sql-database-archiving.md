abstract: "This poster visualizes the roadmap of Digital Archive Flanders (DAF) for
  the archiving of a SQL database. This roadmap contains six steps. Once a client
  requests an integration procedure for an application (step1), DAF develops a time
  frame (step 2). Subsequently, the functional analysis maps the relevant information,
  files, metadata, extensions on the metadata model and the trigger for archiving
  (step 3). In the testing phase (step 4), a small dataset has to be ingested in a
  testing platform and this test and metadata has to be controlled. Afterwards, an
  API integration will transfer all the relevant data to the E-depot (step 5). Finally,
  clients can use the digitally stored information for their daily business processes
  (step 6) [1]. The poster focuses on the functional analysis, the testing-phase and
  the different problems which occurred during a case study. At the end, the poster
  presents some general lessons for future database archiving cases. \n[1] Q. Oeyen.
