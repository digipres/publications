abstract: "Constructing a Preservation Technical Registry: Leveraging Community Best
  Practices\n\nDeveloping a machine-readable and continuously updated registry of
  preservation policies and actions is critical for a digital preservation repository
  accommodating diverse resource types and designated user communities. To enhance
  the automated preservation workflow within the National Digital Preservation Program
  (NDDP), we conducted a comparative analysis of current technical registries in the
  digital preservation (DP) community. Our assessment focused on the breadth of format
  coverage, the completeness of risk factors, the frequency of information updates,
  and the interoperability. \n\nFollowing this evaluation, we selected the Preservation
  Action Registry (PAR) as the foundation for our implementation framework. We extended
  PAR ( https://concept.preservica.com/par-browser/home.php ) with descriptive information
  and example dataset other representative registries and the legacy practices of
  the NDPP.\n\nThis presentation primarily focuses on three key aspects:\n1.\t**Designing
  the data model:** We customized the Schema and API of the Preservation Action Registry
  (PAR) to cater to our internal workflow logic while keeping the universal API.\n2.\t**Aggregating
  format risk factors:** We sourced risk factors from reputable repositories such
  as the Library of Congress's Recommended Format Specifications (RFS), WikiDP, and
  NARA's preservation framework. Subsequently, we designed NDPPâ€™s format risk quantification
  formula based on these factors. \n3.\t**Implementing dynamic updates:** Our system
  is capable of dynamically detecting updates from community information sources and
  triggering preservation activities for relevant archived resources in time."
