abstract: 'The SIP-creator is an application to simplify the entry of dossiers and
  items into the E-depot (the digital repository of Digital Archive Flanders). This
  entry is done by creating a Submission Information Package (SIP). In practice, this
  involves a .zip file that consists of a metadata file (conforming to our metadata
  scheme and the dossiers and items themselves. The creation and uploading of SIPs
  in the E-depot will be simplified because the customer can easily map their own
  metadata model to the DAV model, automatically read and fill in metadata in the
  metadata file, generate SIPs that comply with the requirements of the E-depot, and
  finally place the SIP on the customer''s FTPS environment, after which it is picked
  up by the E-depot.


  The first phase of the tool was created out of necessity: our clients often have
  to re-upload a SIP because various errors were made against our metadata model.
  With our SIP-Creator application we want to prevent those errors and streamline
  their ingest workflow. By the iPRES event, we will have completed our second phase
  of development. The second phase will be focused on the ingest of descriptions for
  analogue archive into our E-depot. This is needed because both digital material
  and analogue descriptions are housed in the same environment and described and accessed
  according to the same standard.'
