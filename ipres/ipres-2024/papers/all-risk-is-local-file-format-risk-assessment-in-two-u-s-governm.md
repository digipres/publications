abstract: Evaluating file formats is an integral component of risk assessment for
  digital content. Understanding a file from a technical standpoint is important but
  equally as so is understanding the institution’s ability to preserve it for the
  long term. In other words, all risk is local. But how to assess that risk in a meaningful
  and consistent way across widely diverse collections? There is no one size fits
  all approach. Instead, institutions of all sizes can assess format risk in a manner
  that is appropriate for their organization. Two U.S. federal government agencies,
  the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and the Library of Congress
  discuss their approaches to risk assessment through digital file format assessment
  including the similarities and differences in their approaches, which were designed
  to meet the different goals of their institutions. The Library of Congress utilizes
  a number of mechanisms including the Recommended Formats Statement, which has a
  defined and publicly available evaluation criteria matrix, as well as research from
  the Sustainability of Digital Formats. NARA issues Transfer Guidance that identifies
  preferred and acceptable file formats for the transfer of permanent records for
  preservation, as well as guidance for federal records managers about specific categories
  of records, such as email or social media. NARA's guidance is based on a risk assessment
  process for individual versions of formats, which is shared publicly through the
  NARA Digital Preservation Framework. Both NARA and Library of Congress’ approaches
  were born from a shared framework which diverged over time to meet each institution’s
  goals and needs.
