abstract: "This workshop invites attendees to experiment with a new Self Assessment
  Tool that identifies preservability risk factors for complex works and offers recommendations
  to content creators that could improve their project’s preservation outlook. The
  workshop is for anyone preserving complex works (or interested in doing so) that
  may need to assess their preservability. It is especially relevant to those who
  interface with content creators and have opportunities to give feedback to improve
  preservation outcomes - for example, those working with digital humanities researchers.\n\nThe
  tool is being developed from five years of research into the preservability of new
  forms of scholarship (i.e., complex works characterized by the variety of digital
  enhancements such as audio, video, data visualizations, nonlinear navigation, etc.,
  that are integrated alongside or in lieu of text). For this research, preservation
  experts [worked with publishers/platforms][1] and [evaluated complex publications][2]
  to determine their risk factors for preservability. From this they suggested [interventions
  (“Guidelines”) to reduce risks][3] based on preservation method (web archiving,
  export etc.) and format. \n\nThe research identified a need to share advice about
  improving preservability of scholarship with content creators in an actionable way.
  The Self Assessment Tool aims to meet this need. The tool uses a process workflow
  that unfolds over several conversations. It includes a set of questions and access
  points into the Guidelines.\n\nThe workshop will start with a short introduction
  to the Self Assessment Tool, highlighting scenarios from the research that illustrate
  features that can be difficult to preserve alongside relevant guidance for those
  scenarios. In small groups, participants will then test facets of the tool working
  through questions, identifying risks, and mapping them to suggested interventions
  from the Guidelines. Attendees are encouraged to bring their own examples of scholarly
  works with preservation challenges and to explore the Guidelines, considering how
  they might be implemented to improve preservability. \n\nFinally, team members will
  lead a conversation about attendees’ experiences working with the tool, seeking
  insights into areas for improvement, and an understanding of how useful the tool
  could be for the communities with whom they work.\n\n\n  [1]: https://guides.nyu.edu/blog/The-Andrew-W-Mellon-Foundation-Awards-NYU-502400-For-Libraries-Project-to-Expand-Capabilities-F\n
