abstract: It is discerned from literature that digitally preserving indigenous knowledge
  in the context of climate change is particularly important because indigenous communities
  often possess unique understandings and strategies for managing natural resources
  and responding to environmental changes. Their knowledge can provide valuable insights
  into sustainable living and adaptation strategies that are crucial in the face of
  global climate change. Owing to the risk of losing oral history and indigenous knowledge
  due to climatic changes and displacements resulting from conflicts in the Northeast
  of Nigeria, this study set out with the overall aim of creating a condition where
  indigenous knowledge is digitized and is securely maintained for the present and
  future generations. This attempt was made through the assessment of organisational
  capacity of Ramat Library by utilising the Digital Preservation Coalition Rapid
  Assessment Model (DPC RAM). This research proposes using the six elements of the
  DPC RAM as a basis for beginning the evaluation and progression towards sustainable
  digital preservation of indigenous knowledge regarding climate change adaptation.
  The Ramat Library at the University of Maiduguri was utilized for the practical
  application. The findings in this paper shows that there are fundamental issues
  hampering the digital preservation of indigenous knowledge. Some of these issues
  are policy related, lack of technical literacy by library staff members and poor
  collaboration between Library and wider community amongst others.
