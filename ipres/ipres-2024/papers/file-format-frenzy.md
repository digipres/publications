abstract: 'This is an interactive, choose your own adventure game designed to teach
  players file format analysis and how to identify various file formats. It is built
  using the twine platform with various side games and quests built in.


  The premise of the game is that you shrink into a computer that has been infected
  by a virus. You quickly realise that the files on the computer do not know what
  they are anymore and by solving a series of puzzles you must help them piece together
  their identity. This is created with the goal of helping the player understand concepts
  such as magic bytes, how to look inside a file, hex and many of the tools of file
  format analysis.


  The hope is that this will be a valuable and fun learning tool to understand files
  in repositories and how file format identification software such as PRONOM and DROID
  work. These are topics that can often seem intimidating and inaccessible but with
  gamification they may reach a wider audience.


  For the session laptops will be recommended for participants to reach the website
  the game is hosted on, however shorter games and paper versions of the side quests
  will be available. Participants could also work in teams around one laptop. Therefore
  the game could be played solo or in groups.'
