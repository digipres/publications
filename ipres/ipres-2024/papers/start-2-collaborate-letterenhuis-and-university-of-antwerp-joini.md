abstract: "The nature of paper archives has never required close collaboration between
  archives and researchers – researchers could easily access records within archival
  boundaries and in a purely transactional frame. Born-digital archives, however,
  provide strong arguments for both parties to engage actively and even require creators
  to be more involved. The case for partnerships between archivists, researchers and
  literary authors in dealing with born-digital archives has been made many times,
  but only continues to grow in importance as more born-digital archives are making
  their way into literary archival institutions (Pulkkinen 2023; Jaillant 2022; Ries
  & Palkó 2019; Gooding, Smith & Mann, 2019). \nThe scale and complexity of born-digital
  archives enforces strong partnerships between creators, archives and research in
  order to guarantee a real future for born-digital (literary) heritage. Genuine collaboration
  between scholars and archivists creates many pathways for developing and enhancing
  archival workflows for acquiring, describing and unlocking born-digital archives
  for research. Researchers get better acquainted with limitations and possibilities
  of born-digital archives, enabling them to articulate solid research questions.
  Collaboration with creators is no less important, as they play a crucial role in
  the preservation of their digital documents (Micunovic, Marčetić, and Krtalić 2016).\nIn
  this Lightning Talk we share our experience of the collaboration between the Letterenhuis
  (Isabelle Van Ongeval) and the University of Antwerp (Lamyk Bekius) in the scope
  of born-digital archives. Our regular meetings to discuss approaches and research
  interests regarding born-digital archives have already led to concrete results.
  These include: joining forces in persuading Flemish authors to donate their old
  computers to the Letterenhuis and make them available for research projects; working
  together on a project with the Flemish poet Maud Vanhauwaert to log the writing
  process of a poem for the Letterenhuis’ new collection exhibition; an exploration
  of the filecontents on the floppy disks of the Flemish poet and essayist Herman
  de Coninck to make them more findable and more accessible for research; and partnering
  up for the (proposed) CLARIAH-VL+ International Research Infrastructure, in which
  we plan to develop a model for the description of born-digital and hybrid (literary)
  archives."
