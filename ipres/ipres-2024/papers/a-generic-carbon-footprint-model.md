abstract: 'We have previously reported the carbon footprint calculations for the National
  Digital Preservation Services in Finland, e.g. as a short paper in iPRES 2023. We
  have found out in our calculations that the carbon footprint for the hardware, including
  both manufacturing, transportation and disposal costs, has a profound impact on
  the total carbon footprint of our service platform. In our platform, the hardware
  component carbon footprint is much greater that the service life carbon footprint
  (electricity consumption). Now it is time to expand our carbon footprint calculations
  and create a generic model for calculating the footprint in cases where hardware
  manufacturers do not report the in-body carbon footprint (includes hardware manufacturing,
  logistics and disposal) figures for their hardware.


  The basic assumption is that all servers, regardless of the manufacturer, share
  components which have an in-body carbon footprint reported by at least one vendor.
  We will turn this sparse matrix for server component in-body carbon footprint values
  into a generic server components in-body carbon footprint calculation. This generic
  calculation is estimated to be fairly accurate and the goal is to develop this into
  an open model for hardware component carbon footprint calculation. This model would
  be highly beneficial to the digital preservation community in general, as it could
  be used by any producer of a digital preservation service to calculate their hardware
  component carbon footprint, without having to have separate in-depth discussions
  with their hardware manufacturers.


  Since the previous report from 2023, the National Digital Preservation Services
  have expanded the platform to 7.5 Petabytes and the server manufacturer has been
  changed from HPE to Kaytus. At the same time the Kaytus hardware lifespan has been
  extended into 7 years. We have also replaced one data centre, the new data centre
  having a PUE of 1.05 while the previous data centre had a PUE of 1.66. This poster
  will use our current digital preservation platform, allowing for up to 7.5 Petabytes
  of data, as an example when creating a generic carbon footprint calculation using
  the previous assumptions detailed above.'
