abstract: "In a dramatic intervention in 2022, [Tamar Evangelista Dougherty challenged
  iPres to recognize community leaders][1] as legitimate and necessary collaborators
  in digital preservation. That call was given fresh impetus in 2023 by Sherry Williams
  and Ricky Punzalan who further articulated the barriers and benefits of community-engaged
  preservation. This panel progresses that discussion through the lens of ‘post-custodial’
  approaches to digital preservation for ‘community-generated digital content’. ‘[Post-custodial][2]’
  in this context refers to efforts that empower community centered data creators
  to preserve their own content when traditional memory institutions are not available
  or appropriate.  \n\nThe panel emerges from the ‘Our Heritage Our Stories’ project
  which has explored the challenges of sustaining a large number of small-scale, community-based
  digitization initiatives in the UK.  It draws on research, current practice, and
  case studies to propose a post-custodial toolkit for community generated digital
  content.  The toolkit is designed to improve the preservation outcomes of data classed
  as ‘[critically endangered][3]’ in the 2023 Global List of Endangered Digital Species.
  \n\nPost-custodial approaches are not devoid of problems.  For example, what is
  the appropriate relationship between community-driven approaches and existing memory
  institutions?  Do they undermine well established workflows; and how much is gained
  in return? How do we enable participatory metadata creation and management?  What
  technical steps are needed? How to resolve disputed meanings and contested access
  within preservation practice? How do post-custodial approaches relate to decolonization?
  Is there alignment with emerging expectations of indigenous data sovereignty in
  countries colonized by the West? What can be learned from the indigenous data sovereignty
  movement to enable community ownership of digital materials by marginalized or precarious
  groups in colonizing nations?\n\nThis lively panel will introduce and review post-custodial
  models of digital preservation and set them in a global perspective.  It will provoke
  comment from practitioners from different contexts, including from Aotearoa / New
  Zealand where data sovereignty principles have been impactful in the protection
  of land, culture and knowledge. Thus, the panel will maintain momentum through two
  previous iPres conferences while anticipating themes which are certain to arise
  in the next. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDEWqey559M\n  [2]: https://dictionary.archivists.org/entry/postcustodial.html\n
