abstract: "In this panel session, current and future approaches for digital moving
  image content – film, video, television, and streaming - will be discussed. With
  concepts applying to both born digital and digitized moving image content, this
  session will provide a foundational overview of digital moving image files, including
  formats and technical characteristics, and will provide insight into how three of
  the leading moving image archives are meeting the challenges of long-term preservation
  of our collective moving image heritage. \n\nThe session will begin with an introduction
  to working with digital moving image content, including basic concepts of digital
  moving image content, codecs and containers, lossy vs lossless files, and impact
  of sound and image quality on file sizes. Good practice will also be discussed.
  The introduction also includes a brief discussion of both consumer and entertainment
  industry formats. The presenters will share open source tools and resources available
  for processing moving image content - democratizing capabilities for processing
  moving image content. \n\nPanel participants will share current workflows for moving
  image content, including use of scripted workflows, open source tools, specialized
  hardware, and a combination of approaches to ensure the preservation of our moving
  image heritage. The discussion will also include acceptable formats and the necessity
  to be flexible on accepted formats while retaining a focus on formats appropriate
  for long-term preservation. \n\nParticipants will also discuss current challenges
  working with high volumes of content, and the increasingly large digital moving
  image files and file sets as well as the entertainment industry’s drive to produce
  higher quality content and the impact on cultural heritage institution resources.
  Participants will have time to ask questions and engage in meaningful discussion
  with the panel members."
