abstract: "**Intangible cultural heritage (ICH)** is very much alive: practices evolve
  over time and adapt to a fast-changing world. Communities, groups and individuals
  are the prime custodians of ICH. The existing approaches and methodologies for linking
  data in tangible heritage cannot be practised in the context of (meta)dating ICH.\n\nDuring
  the project pURIs for immaterieelerfgoed.be: Building Blocks for Digital Transformation
  in the Cultural Heritage Sector, NGO Workshop Intangible Heritage Flandres researched
  how to develop a persistent and sustainable data practise for ICH. The project addressed
  **questions relating to the tension between the principles behind open data on the
  one hand, and the stewardship of communities over their living and evolving ICH
  on the other**. Immaterieelerfgoed.be is the platform for ICH in Flanders and Brussels.
  It includes inventories of ICH. The content of these inventories mainly take on
  the form of descriptive data and are collated through co-creation.\n\n**To achieve
  an ethical data practice, the rights and well-being of the ICH community involved
  in all phases of the data life cycle on - and beyond - immaterieelerfgoed.be have
  to be prioritised**. The aim is to reduce the potential harm that data sharing may
  cause to the communities involved, e.g. the misuse of heritage that has customary
  restrictions on access and use). By building upon known principles for data sharing,
  combining FAIR (open and persistent data sharing) and CARE (people and purposes
  oriented data sharing), a methodology to map the current data practice applied on
  immaterieelerfgoed.be has been developed. Additionally a series of actions to establish
  an ethical data strategy, ensuring both clean and open data and agency and advocacy
  of the ICH communities, has been discerned. \n\nDuring the course of the project,
  we scrutinised the current registration module for the ICH inventories, applied
  user agreements and privacy policies and the attribution of rights statements and
  reuse licences (e.g. Creative Commons). We researched how we can implement persistent
  URIâ€™s and install an opt-out option for them without breaking their persistence.
  In addition we found that it is indispensable that the communities concerned have
  to be sensitised about the impact of sharing their data."
