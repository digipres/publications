  Meemoo digitises images and audio for its content partners in cultural, media, and
  government sectors. We also manage the influx of their existing digital collections
  into our archive system, where the content is sustainably preserved. However, most
  material has almost no metadata attached, making it unfindable. Therefore, we have
  developed an AI-metadata pipeline that automatically adds metadata to video content,
  enhancing its searchability. This AI-driven approach helps make content findable
  and accessible, unlocking it for future generations.


  Our AI metadata pipeline has a microservice-based architecture capable of processing
  large datasets while keeping processing costs low. To date, we have processed more
  than 150,000 hours of video material. Our facial recognition pipeline combines several
  open-source models for face detection (YuNet, Mediapipe) and face recognition (MagFace).
  For speech-to-text, we use SpeechMatics, a high-quality, multilanguage SaaS speech
  engine. For entity recognition and linking on the transcripts, we utilize TextRazor,
  a multilingual SaaS engine.


  We will demonstrate the power of our pipeline by processing material from the Video
  Person-Clustering Dataset and the YouCook2 Dataset. This demonstration will apply
  facial recognition, speech-to-text, entity recognition, and entity linking models,
  to create AI-generated metadata and illustrate the improved searchability. While
  whisking in new insights and sprinkling some Generative AI (GenAI) on top, we will
  enable content creation and transformation, baking up the future potential of our
  technology.
