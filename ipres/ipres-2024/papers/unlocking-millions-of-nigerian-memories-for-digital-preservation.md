abstract: 'How do we preserve our past and guide against issues that gave rise to
  the Boko Haram mayhem of the North East, the herders/famers clash which spread across
  North Central and extending to the Southern part of Nigeria, how do we ensure that
  we’ve learnt our lessons from the EndSars incidents, the flash flood of Lokoja in
  2022, the banditry and kidnapping cases that we hear about daily if we don’t digitally
  preserve our history.

  Floods, a consequence of increasingly unpredictable weather patterns, have wreaked
  havoc on our physical archives. Roofs are leaking, and water is relentlessly damaging
  precious documents that hold the keys to our history. The memories of our people,
  stored in these fragile repositories, are fading away with every passing day.

  But this isn''t just a loss of the past—it''s a significant impediment to our future.
  A nation that cannot remember where it came from cannot navigate where it is going.
  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which aim to create a better and more
  sustainable future for all, rely heavily on a country''s ability to learn from its
  history, adapt, and innovate. Without preserving our memories, our progress towards
  these goals is severely hindered.

  However, there is hope. Digital preservation offers a beacon of light in these dark
  times. By converting our physical archives into digital formats, we can protect
  them from the elements and ensure their longevity. Digital archives can be easily
  replicated and stored in multiple locations, providing a safeguard against disasters
  that could otherwise erase our history.

  Yet, the task ahead is monumental and cannot be achieved in isolation. We are bleeding
  for partnerships—collaborations with governmental bodies, private sectors, international
  organizations, and passionate individuals. Together, we can pool resources, share
  expertise, and develop innovative solutions to preserve Nigeria''s memories.'
