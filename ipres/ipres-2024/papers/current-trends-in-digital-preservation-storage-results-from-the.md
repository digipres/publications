abstract: "Providing storage as part of the digital preservation program is a key
  element to safeguard the ever-increasing volume of digital holdings. Organizations
  are faced with many challenges managing the technical infrastructure needed for
  their digital preservation storage. The National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA)
  Storage Survey Working Group conducted a survey in 2023 to gain an understanding
  of how organizations around the world manage digital preservation storage. Responses
  were received from 14 countries. The goal of this longitudinal study was to gather
  information on how new technologies and standards have impacted preservation storage
  and to compare results to the previous data collected in 2011, 2013, and 2019.\nThe
  survey working group reviewed questions from the previous three surveys, retaining
  as many questions as feasible while removing or revising those that were no longer
  pertinent and adding questions on current concerns, including environmental impact.
  The questions were thematically grouped in five sections: General Storage Environments;
  Geographically Distributed Copies; Preservation Storage Requirements and Services;
  Preservation Planning and Organizational Commitment; and Demographics.\nThe poster
  will share current trends based on key findings from the survey, including a shift
  away from collaborative storage models compared to previous surveys, an increase
  in the use of commercial cloud storage, and a greater acceptance of the use of cloud
  storage. The full report features a breakdown of specific cloud storage services
  used by institution type, statistics on self-hosting vs. outsourcing when managing
  digital preservation and the types of services performed, as well as information
  on amounts of digital storage used and plans for meeting future needs. New to the
  2023 survey are questions about environmental impact, where respondents gave practical
  suggestions to lessen environmental impact while collections continue to grow. \nAnyone
  working with digital content inevitably confronts the challenge of escalating storage
  demands, which frequently surpass available resources.  Examining prevailing trends
  and learning othersâ€™ approaches to digital preservation storage can provide valuable
  insight, tangible examples, and facilitate the identification of shared goals and
  objectives, aiding in advocacy efforts."
