abstract: The digital transformation in Brazilian public administration has created
  an urgent need to produce, maintain, preserve, and provide access to authentic and
  reliable digital records. With the advent of technological advances, digital transformation,
  and the coronavirus pandemic, these changes have become essential throughout Brazilian
  public administration. This poster presents an overview of the current state of
  digital preservation of records related to the Brazilian justice system. The objectives
  of the research are to identify Brazilian public institutions that work with the
  digital preservation of records within the scope of the justice system, analyze
  the digital preservation actions established in normative acts and on the websites
  of the selected institutions, request access to information related to the organizational
  resources of the digital preservation of these institutions, and diagnose digital
  preservation actions in the Brazilian justice system based on the institutions researched
  and the organizational resources made available in the Digital Preservation Coalition's
  Rapid Assessment Model. Thus, the institutions were identified and selected within
  the scope of the empirical framework, followed by a survey and documentary analysis,
  and requests for access to information related to the organizational resources of
  these institutions. Finally, the current state of digital preservation actions in
  the Brazilian justice system was diagnosed based on this preliminary investigation.
  The research is characterized as exploratory and descriptive, with a qualitative
  approach, of a social and applied nature. As a result of this research, four institutions
  were selected, two Superior Courts and two Public Ministries, these representing
  a Union power and a state unit. Although organizational capabilities for digital
  preservation are in basic development, there is still much to be done. Therefore,
  the periodic application of digital preservation maturity assessment models in each
  institution of the Brazilian justice system is necessary for internal monitoring
  and progress.
