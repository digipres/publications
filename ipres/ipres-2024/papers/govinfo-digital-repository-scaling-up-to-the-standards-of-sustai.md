abstract: 'GovInfo to Scale

  The US Government Publishing Office, GPO, is the only organization in the the United
  States to be named as a Trustworthy Digital Repository under ISO 16363:2012 Space
  data and information transfer systems -- Audit and certification of trustworthy
  digital repositories and certification under CoreTrustSeal, a peer-reviewed form
  of repository assessment. Currently, GovInfo ingests an average of 6,000 Submission
  Information Packages (SIPs) of Federal Government information content per week from
  over 25 Government organizations and authors. GovInfo collections include born-digital
  publications and government information published as early as 1789. GovInfo has
  over 3,393,462 Archival Information Packages of digital Government information objects.
  These packages contain more than 11.6 million individual PDF files, 30 million images,
  audio files, spreadsheets, and more. In FY23, over 195 thousand packages were added
  to GovInfo. The approximate volume of all AIP content is 99 TB. Depending on the
  complexity of the packages submitted for ingest, processing normally takes less
  than 5 minutes per package. In FY23, the repository received an estimated 1,1 billion
  document retrievals from GovInfo.


  Through What Means?

  GovInfo was established in 2009, prior to the commercial availability of many repository
  services. GPO has evolved and shaped the repository over time through a series of
  collection-defined metadata rules, file management operations, processors, and processing
  mechanisms through a series of micro-services within the overall architectural design
  of the repository. This poster will feature highlights of this repository design,
  including newly added tools that allow for multiple types of PDF validation, technical
  metadata extraction, PII detection, characterization of content, and custom, rule-based
  parsing of all content. Recent additions to the repository such as the Congressionally
  Mandated Reports collection highlights how GPO is adding additional machine-readable
  formats, responding to legislative requirements, and working with federal agencies
  to increase access to government information. GPO’s team will demonstrate GPO proactively
  responds to common problems such as file corruption, password protection, image
  quality, metadata errors, enhanced content description, publication linking, digital
  signatures, content navigation, among other common problems. Additionally, this
  poster will feature access points beyond our web interface including RSS, Sitemaps,
  APIs, and Bulk Data download functionality.'
