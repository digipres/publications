abstract: "In this paper we want to share our experience and learning curve regarding
  the digitization of the Panorama of Congo. This is a large (115 meters x 14 meters,
  1610m2) painting (oil on canvas) made by two Belgian painters for the International
  Exhibition in Ghent (1913). It was created to propagate the Belgian involvement
  in Congo. Today, it is part of the collection of the War Heritage Institute in Belgium.
  In its lifetime it was only exhibited twice. Since its last exhibition at the Brussels’
  World Fair of 1935, the painting has been in storage. Due to its scale, its material
  condition and the need for a large custom-built building to display it, chances
  the canvas itself will be exhibited in the foreseeable future are extrtemely small.
  This situation called for a ‘digital rescue operation’. With very few best practices
  for working on this scale available, the team devised a working method to unroll
  and photograph the canvas. Among other things, the working method included 15+ volunteers
  and two tanks from the Belgian Army. After months of preparation, the painting was
  photographed in a military warehouse by a team of photographers from the research
  team in December 2022. This was followed by an intensive period of stitching the
  800+ images together. Next to the technical challenges of this process, we want
  to highlight some ethical implications of digitizing  colonial heritage. \nThe photography
  of the Panorama of Congo is the first work package of the FILM EU Research Innovation
  Transformation research pilot 'CONGO VR' (Horizon 2020). The project, which looks
  at the affordances of virtual reality for decolonizing heritage, is a collaboration
  between LUCA School of Arts (Brussels), Lusofona University (Lisbon) and the Institute
  for Art Design + Technology (Dublin). https://congopanorama.filmeu.eu/"
