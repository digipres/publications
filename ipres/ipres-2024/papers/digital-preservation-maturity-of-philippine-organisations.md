abstract: This poster reports on the results from a series of workshops with Philippine
  archivists to assess their organizationsâ€™ digital preservation practices using a
  variety of maturity models. Conducted following a training needs survey, the workshops
  guided 120 participants in assessing the digital preservation infrastructure of
  their respective organizations using a variant of the Digital Preservation Coalition
  Rapid Assessment Model (DPC RAM) which resulted in 89 completed assessments. The
  poster models the results as a spider chart and explores solutions to address findings
  that indicate a general lack of awareness, an absence of policies, and ambivalence
  from management to prioritize digital preservation as an essential program with
  human and financial resources to match.
