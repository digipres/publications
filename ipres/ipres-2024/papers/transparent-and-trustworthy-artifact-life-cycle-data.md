abstract: In scholarly communication, alternative publication platforms are rising,
  offering services that are not tied to and function independently from traditional
  publishers. Decentralized and decoupled versions of value-adding services such as
  overlay journals, peer review, and endorsement services are provided to the network.
  These alternatives address not only the massive monopolization of scholarly communication
  but also new demands for rapid distribution of scholarly artifacts in fields such
  as life sciences. They also accommodate new publication formats, such as data sets
  and source code that are beyond the traditional paper. Event Notifications provide
  an asynchronous point-to-point messaging protocol that acts as an interoperability
  layer between the nodes in such networks. Event Logs are a proposal to provide full
  transparency in the scholarly process by publishing public resources on each node
  containing lifecycle information pertaining to the scholarly artifacts in the network.
  Trust in Event Logs requires some form of machine verifiability because trust by
  reputation of each node is not scalable in large networks. This paper presents a
  pragmatic approach to building trust without relying on costly blockchain technologies,
  which lack sustainable long-term strategies. By using trusted archival nodes within
  Event Notification networks and Event Logs, we propose a decentralized, transparent,
  and trustworthy alternative to traditional scholarly communication systems.
