abstract: "The FAIR-IMPACT project (https://fair-impact.eu/) supports the implementation
  of FAIR-enabling practices, tools, and services. To this end, guidelines (https://fair-impact.eu/transparency-guidelines
  & https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10058634) and a prototype are being developed to
  improve the transparency of, and trust in, repositories. These guidelines help to
  expose relevant information as metadata at the organisational and object level to
  facilitate discovery, provide context, and support interoperability. The guidelines
  will also recommend accompanying evidence to create a sense of trust in the services
  themselves and service providers with focus put on exposing information about characteristics
  (e.g. contact information), information that can help to inform a sense or status
  of trustworthiness (e.g. preservation policy), and information relating to FAIRness
  of the digital objects held. The guidelines, and an implementation prototype, will
  establish relevance of the resources for stakeholders and it is essential that they
  are informed by community-input. \n\nThis poster will give insights on the modelling
  of the complex relations, the guidelines, and prototype, in order to encourage discussions
  and collect feedback from communities, including digital repositories, service providers,
  and users, so that we can ensure that the guidelines meet the needs of all stakeholders.
  \n\nWhilst certification for research data repositories exists (e.g. CoreTrustSeal)
  not all digital object services have an external authority assessing and validating
  the service provided. Therefore, this model will also support the transparent disclosure
  of self-declared assertions about functions and activities. This structured and
  interoperable format of information expression supports harvesting and validation
  by third parties, which reduces administrative overhead, improves interoperability,
  and benefits the wider research landscape. \n\nFAIR assessment of digital objects
  can be undertaken by anyone, however, a clear understanding of the results of an
  assessment requires further evidence regarding the assessment process. This is particularly
  important when assessment metrics are selected or adapted for a disciplinary context.
  The guidelines will therefore include the exposure of assessment characteristics,
  such as a FAIR assessment authority, the tool, its creators, and the evidence they
  hold.\n\nA prototype implementing the guidelines will serve as a proof of concept,
  illustrating the core functionality and purpose of the guidelines, showcasing mapping,
  reuse, and validating the evidence."
