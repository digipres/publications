abstract: The practice of digital preservation tends to be well-established at larger
  institutions such as academic research libraries, governments and NGOs, and other
  well-resourced organizations. However, in aggregate the bulk of cultural heritage
  materials, including those in digital form, are held by the tens of thousands of
  smaller organizations dedicated to preserving local memory collections such as public
  libraries, historical societies, regional museums, and community archives. These
  smaller organizations are also more focused on preserving the lives and accomplishments
  of everyday citizens and local history -- collection building that greatly diversifies
  the archival record well beyond the institutional self-documentation or collections
  of famous/entitled people that tend to characterize the collections of larger organizations.
  Since 1996, Internet Archive (IA) has worked with over 1,500 organizations both
  big and small to provide digital archiving and preservation services, tools, expertise,
  advocacy, training and open-source technologies. In 2023, IA launched the Vault
  digital preservation service to better meet the needs of institutions, including
  smaller ones, that require an affordable, extensible, mission-aligned, non-profit
  digital preservation service option. In this paper/presentation, we will outline
  the many lessons learned from extensive discussion, research, needs assessment,
  and practical experience, both from the perspective of the institutions themselves
  and from the perspective of building a non-profit software-as-a-service platform
  that aims to meet the needs of the smaller LAM community. The paper will detail
  findings on the various challenges of doing digital preservation at smaller organizations,
  including financial/budgetary realities, issues of staffing and policy, technology
  capacity limitations, and overall program management and sustainability challenges.
  The paper will then describe how these challenges were addressed in product development,
  cost modeling, and community cultivation in building a digital preservation service
  that incorporates these findings into its service design. Finally, the paper will
  propose various strategies for digital preservation practices and community building
  to be more inclusive of smaller organizations and ways that the larger community
  can collectively empower smaller organizations to help advance the global digital
  preservation effort.
