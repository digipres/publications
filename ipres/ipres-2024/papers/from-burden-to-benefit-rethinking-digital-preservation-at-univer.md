abstract: In this paper, we aim to use the approach to the digital preservation of
  research data at VU Amsterdam as a case study to show the importance and benefits
  of organising digital preservation from a user-centric perspective. We show that
  awareness raising is not enough to change the existing practices, as many reasons
  stop individuals from reaching out to central support services despite the awareness
  of their existence. Instead, we strive to put the researcher at the heart of our
  digital preservation support services by truly listening to their needs and creating
  an ecosystem that supports individuals on every step of their journey and makes
  digital preservation a natural part of their workflow.
