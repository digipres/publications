abstract: 'This paper investigates the management and preservation of audiovisual
  documents within Omani institutions, given their significance as records of institutional
  memory and heritage. Audiovisual materials face unique threats of deterioration
  and technological obsolescence that necessitate tailored preservation approaches.
  Through a qualitative field study utilizing semi-structured interviews, this research
  assessed the current state, strategies, perceived value, and digitization practices
  for audiovisual content across various Omani institutions, including archives, libraries,
  and information centers.

  Key findings reveal that while usage rates are high at 35%, concrete preservation
  strategies tailored to multimedia remain inadequate, coupled with technology and
  policy-related obstacles. This highlights the need for dedicated digitization, training,
  and policy initiatives to safeguard audiovisual content, given their vulnerability
  and value as records of institutional identities.

  The implications indicate the necessity of a collaborative national approach combining
  governmental, institutional, and community efforts to formulate multifaceted preservation
  strategies addressing related dimensions. Standardizing practices through training
  programs and global standards alignment are also integral for accessible and enduring
  multimedia conservation. As repositories of cultural heritage, dedicated audiovisual
  management frameworks will ensure their persistence for posterity.'
