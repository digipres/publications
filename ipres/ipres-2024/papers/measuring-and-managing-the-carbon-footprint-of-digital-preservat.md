abstract: Being able to measure and manage the carbon emissions of long-term digital
  preservation is an important aspect of environmental sustainability.  Digital preservation
  is an active process involving the ongoing use of computer systems and data storage.  This
  involves physical infrastructure and ICT equipment, the need for power and cooling,
  and a cycle of migrations and renewal.  All of which generate carbon emissions,
  not just from energy consumption but also as a result of the embodied footprint
  from the manufacture, transportation and eventual disposal of the ICT equipment
  involved.  But how big is this footprint?  What aspects of digital preservation
  contribute most such as ingest or long-term storage?  How do emissions depend on
  the type of content being preserved, what preservation actions are performed, and
  where preservation takes place such as in the cloud?  Without being able to measure
  and calculate carbon emissions, it is hard to work out how best to reduce these
  emissions, or indeed whether other organisational activities offer lower hanging
  fruit.   This poster explores these areas, presents a methodology for measuring
  carbon emissions of digital preservation, and gives some real numbers from large
  scale digital preservation in the cloud using real data for a range of digital preservation
  scenarios.   The poster includes debunking a few misconceptions about the carbon
  footprint of energy consumption, especially in the cloud, it directs attention to
  the elephant in the room that is the embodied footprint of ICT equipment (servers
  and storage) that form the mainstay of digital preservation systems and infrastructure,
  and it provides some practical suggestions on how to reduce emissions.   The overall
  aim of the poster is to help people understand how they can measure the carbon footprint
  of their digital preservation activities, how they can understand what aspects and
  activities contribute the most, and how they can make their own informed decisions
  on how to make effective reductions.
