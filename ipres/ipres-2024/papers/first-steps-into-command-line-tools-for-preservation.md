abstract: "Do you already use the command line for digital preservation tasks? It’s
  a lightweight, yet powerful instrument that is available on every computer. It allows
  you to manage your computer or automate repetitive tasks, but can also be used to
  carry out digital preservation tasks and quality control, with tools like e.g. Jhove,
  FFmpeg, bagIT, rclone, ExifTool, Xmlstarlet or Siegfried. Useful for every (digital)
  archivist whose nature of work has shifted from paper to digital. \n\nWhy use the
  command line?\n-------------------------\n\nThe command line is one of the most
  useful and efficient tools we have as computer users, but it can feel overwhelming
  when you first start using the tool. Small cultural heritage organisations do not
  always have the means to hire a full-time IT professional, requiring employees to
  familiarise themselves with new digital skills and tools. In our hands-on workshop,
  we will guide the participants in taking their first steps using the command line
  to carry out various digital preservation tasks.\n\nWhat will you learn?\n--------------------\nWe
  will dive deeper into tools for working with files in bulk:\n - validating files
  with Jhove or a Tiff validator;\n - transcoding videos with FFmpeg;\n - transferring
  files from an online storage service to an offline storage using rclone;\n- reading
  and writing embedded metadata in image, audio and video with ExifTool;\n- extracting
  information from XML files with Xmlstarlet;\n- identifying files with Siegfried;\n-
  packaging files in a bagIT;\n- ...\n\nThe exact list may change depending on the
  needs or questions of the participants. We expect to introduce 4 to 5 command line
  tools.\n\nThe Windows command prompt and Powershell are not compatible with the
  command line interface of macOS and Ubuntu. That is why Windows users need to install
  Microsoft’s WSL2 and set up Ubuntu before joining the workshop.\nWe will discuss
  the participants needs and questions in a Zoom call which will be organised around
  2 weeks before the workshop. We recommend the participants to join this session
  as it serves as a way to answer technical questions or troubleshoot some installation
  issues before the workshop."
