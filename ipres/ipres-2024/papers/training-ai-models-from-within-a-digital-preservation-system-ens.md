abstract: 'Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning tools are highly dependent
  on the datasets that are used to train them. Building datasets for general purpose
  usage is something that Commercial-Off-The-Shelf tools and services have done well,
  but they are not necessarily tuned to domain specific needs. Creating custom datasets
  for this purpose is often possible with these services, but is often complex or
  imposes complex requirements on an organization seeking to do it.

  This paper describes work undertaken to allow the refinement of datasets and re-training
  of custom models to be performed through simplified user interfaces that can be
  directly embedded within an existing digital preservation system.'
