abstract: "The poster will describe a collaborative effort between the Digital Repository
  of Ireland, Goais, Fiontar & Scoil na Gaeilge (Interdisciplinary School of Irish)
  at Dublin City University and the University of Galway to draft a standardised set
  of Irish language terms relating to Digital Preservation, to produce the list as
  a publication and to disseminate the list to the Digital Preservation community
  in Ireland. The list will also be published  online at tearma.ie and on the Gaois
  database. Irish remains a second and minority language in Ireland, and the project
  attempts to fill gaps in the existing vocabulary of Irish language words and expressions
  to account for digital preservation activities. \n\nThe hope is that the project
  will both facilitate greater Irish language description and accessibility in relation
  to digital preservation activities while also allowing for superior Irish and dual
  language integration of resources that are the subject of digital preservation by
  researchers working in Irish.\n\nThe poster will describe the process by which existing
  preservation terms were collated and how we have identified gaps in the list, created
  new translations and produced a standardised set after review. It will also include
  examples from new list of terms and information on existing resources. A draft set
  of the terms will be presented at the DPC UnConference in Dublin in May 2024 - feedback
  and outcomes from this review will also be included in the poster."
