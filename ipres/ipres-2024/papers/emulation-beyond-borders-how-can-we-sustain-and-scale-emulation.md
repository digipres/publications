abstract: "This interactive session will bring conference participants together to
  discuss how we can collaborate across institutional and geographic borders to sustain
  and scale more equitable engagement with emulation and software preservation. Anyone
  curious about emulation or preserving access to software or born-digital collections
  is welcome and encouraged to participate. \n\nThe emerging EaaSI Research Alliance—an
  international community of libraries, archives, and museums using the Emulation-as-a-Service
  Infrastructure (EaaSI) software—offers a promising opportunity to bolster international
  cooperation and expand adoption of emulation as a method of preserving access to
  software and software-dependent collections. In this session, representatives from
  the Alliance and the Software Preservation Network will facilitate in-person and
  remote participants through a series of gently structured conversations designed
  to foster connections and make space for everyone to contribute. \n\nAfter a quick
  introduction to ground the session, participants will break into groups based on
  geography and organization type (including space for students and jobseekers).  These
  small group discussions will support networking within and outside of geographic
  and organizational definitions, leveraging common context while also imagining beyond
  boundaries. Because the formation of lasting collaborations is a key aim, it would
  be ideal to have time for two rounds of conversations: geographically-based, supporting
  coordination within intellectual property regimes, and institution-type-based, supporting
  cross-border cooperation among organizations with similar missions. \n\nThe prompts
  used in the discussions will illuminate emulation-related points of alignment and
  difference, including salient use cases and challenges related to operational, technical,
  usability, climate impact, or intellectual property concerns. Each group will have
  a designated facilitator from the session team and a pre-identified notetaker. To
  support remote participation, each in-person group will also have a corresponding
  virtual breakout room with a pre-identified facilitator and notetaker. \n\nThe organizers
  will use notes from the session to write a report for the conference proceedings
  and to articulate a potential set of emulation-related strategic priorities for
  the emerging EaaSI Research Alliance, Software Preservation Network, iPRES community,
  and stakeholder communities of practice. A draft of the priorities will be shared
  with session participants for feedback and then published in the Software Preservation
  Network Zenodo community to inspire future action."
