abstract: "Memory institutions are grappling with the challenges posed by digital
  carriers in their collections. While solutions for more recent carriers like hard
  drives, optical discs, and flash storage are readily available, the landscape becomes
  trickier when dealing with older formats such as floppy disks. It is becoming increasingly
  difficult to source the hardware, such as 5.25” floppy drives. There are many boards
  that can read flux streams, including the KryoFlux, and the Award-winning Archivist’s
  Guide to KryoFlux (https://github.com/archivistsguidetokryoflux/archivists-guide-to-kryoflux)
  can help to get started. But KryoFlux is somewhat limited in the disk formats it
  can interpret and might be too expensive for smaller institutions. We came together
  as practitioners because we encountered disk formats that required additional efforts
  to read and extract files from. We explored hardware such as Greaseweazle and using
  FluxEngine software to read less common disk formats. Sharing the knowledge we have
  gained, this tutorial and workshop present an opportunity for participants to delve
  into these formats, examining them from both hardware and formatting perspectives.\n\nThe
  session will start with a tutorial designed to showcase various options and tools
  (FluxEngine, GreaseWeazle), demonstrating how to make aging equipment compatible
  with contemporary machines. At the end of the tutorial, participants should have
  the knowledge to build their own forensic workstation for 5.25” and 3.5” floppy
  disks. \n\nCommencing with case studies, the workshop in the second half of the
  session will unravel the complexities of dealing with obscure formats and share
  valuable lessons learned. Participants will be equipped with practical tips and
  tricks for identification and handling, including utilizing Hex Editors and using
  tools for specific obscure disk formats (such as WANG). The aim is to empower participants
  with the skills and knowledge needed to navigate the challenges associated with
  older formats.\n\nEncouraging an interactive environment, the workshop invites participants
  to share their experiences in tackling obscure formats. Whether seasoned professionals
  or newcomers to the field, everyone is welcome to contribute, fostering a collaborative
  exchange of insights. The inclusive nature of the workshop ensures that participants,
  regardless of their level of expertise, will find value in the discussions and practical
  demonstrations."
