abstract: "The use of DP tools is an essential part of DP practice for most of us.
  We use them to identify, characterise and validate our collections; they give us
  necessary insights into what is going on ‘under the hood’ of our digital files.
  One of the most popular tools in digital preservation is JSTOR/Harvard Object Validation
  Environment (JHOVE), an open source, extensible software framework for identification,
  validation, and characterisation. (Technical) maintenance and further development
  responsibilities lie with the Open Preservation Foundation (OPF).\nWhile there is
  already documentation available on the OPF’s website in the form of release notes,
  user guides, and guides per module, there is also room for improvement. Notably,
  there has been a surge in interest within the past few years regarding the interpretation
  of JHOVE error and warning messages, particularly when confronted with malformed
  or invalid information objects. \nTo address this burgeoning interest and cater
  to the needs of the digital preservation community, the establishment of a specialised
  interest group focusing on the use of JHOVE is proposed. The aim of the group is
  to develop, provide and maintain comprehensive documentation on interpreting JHOVE
  messages effectively and share our experiences and the possible issues we run into.\nIn
  this BoF session, community input is sought to shape the direction of the JHOVE
  Special Interest Group (SIG). What specific resources or initiatives do they envision
  from such a group? These insights will guide the development of tailored solutions
  to meet the community's evolving needs."
