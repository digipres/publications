abstract: "Galleries, libraries, archives, and museums have had little interest in
  preserving the photos from family collections. How interesting then, that in the
  past decade, numerous independent initiatives in at least ten different countries
  have organically sprung up to fill this void. In every case, it's a small team,
  even a single person, whose passion for local history and archival photographs,
  and knowledge of web development, has led them to digitize historical photos, develop
  digital heritage portals, and create communities revolving around local history
  and collective memory. These cooperative history portal initiatives are surprisingly
  technologically innovative–offering sophisticated timeline, mapping, geolocation,
  crowd-source tagging, search/exploration, public discussion, and photo-matching
  tools that allow people from a particular place or country to explore historical
  photos most relevant to them, and to add their local expertise. These initiatives
  are also refreshingly innovative in terms of user experience and aesthetics, and
  have much to teach digital preservation communities about increasing and enlivening
  public engagement with historical photos. \nThis panel presentation will present
  ten examples of cooperative photo history portal initiatives that have emerged independently
  in ten different countries:  Austria (Topotheque), Chile (Enterrano), Estonia (Ajapaik),
  Hungary (Fortepan), Israel (Dokuforte), Malta (MagnaZmien), Romania (Azopan), Russia
  (Pastvu), Switzerland (NotreHistoire), and USA (Fortepan US). Until recently, our
  projects have been doing synchronized swimming in parallel pools. However, we have
  recently found each other through various Creative Commons and individual outreach
  initiatives, and we decided to hold our first consortium meeting in summer 2023.
  Since then, we are meeting regularly and have created OPAN–the Open Portal Archive
  Network (https://opanglobal.org). Our goal is to share our practices and experiences,
  build open source sustainable code (to share), find other similar initiatives in
  other countries, raise awareness of the interest and importance of private family
  archives and the history of everyday people, and create a mosaic of open portal
  archives to preserve and make publicly available the world’s vernacular photos.
  \nWe hope to present the myriad ways in which our individual efforts are inspiring
  people to engage in shared public memory, and find ways in which the digital preservation
  community can benefit from our work."
