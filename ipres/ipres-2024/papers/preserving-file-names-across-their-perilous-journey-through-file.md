abstract: 'File names are more than mere identifiers; they are artifacts of the digital
  environments in which they were created.


  They reflect the technical limitations of specific file systems and, often, the
  cultural context of their creators. As long as a file remains within its original
  environment, its name rarely raises concerns. However, when files are migrated to
  new systems – whether through organizational processes or preservation efforts –
  problems emerge.


  One common approach is to normalize file names by restricting them to a limited
  character set. While technically expedient, this method disregards the intent of
  the original creator. We advocate for retaining original file names whenever possible,
  viewing them as critical traces of context.


  However, this approach is not without challenges. We will discuss specific scenarios
  that have prompted us to re-examine our commitment to preserving original file names.
  These include file names containing control characters, Unicode Extended Use Area
  characters, and characters that are difficult to express in XML. Through case studies,
  we will explore the tension between technical pragmatism and the preservation of
  cultural context in digital objects.


  This lightning talk aims to spark a discussion about the significance of file names
  in digital preservation and to encourage a more nuanced approach that balances technical
  considerations with respect for the cultural and historical value embedded in these
  seemingly mundane digital artifacts.'
