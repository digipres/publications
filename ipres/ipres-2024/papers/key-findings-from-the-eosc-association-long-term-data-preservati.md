abstract: "From 2022 to 2024 the Long Term Data Preservation Task Force (LTDP-TF)
  of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) Association brought together members,
  association experts and external contributors from diverse backgrounds across research
  infrastructures and the digital object management lifecycle to deliver a vision
  and recommendations for optimal preservation of FAIR digital objects. Through a
  sequence of meetings, engagements, a contextual overview paper, an open consultation
  and a final report with recommendations the group identified gaps and proposed actions.
  The key gap, which impacts the development of essential knowledge about roles and
  costs, is the uneven distribution of awareness within EOSC and beyond that active
  preservation requires a long term commitment to data management that must adjust
  to changing technologies and the changing needs of users. Progress on gap analysis
  issues included the recognition of the emerging need for more concrete and clearly
  defined sets of activities and functions for repositories, and the validation of
  the CoreTrustSeal proposed levels of curation and preservation care. Together these
  and the recommendations can support a move towards clearer typologies of repositories
  and their levels of speciality, responsibility, curation and preservation. \nThe
  resources provide bite-sized contextual assertions that can be reused by actors
  at all levels from researchers and practitioners to funders and policy makers. There
  are clear calls to action that are applicable to a range of actors and that guide
  a cascade of progress from European, to national to institutional level. The materials
  address FAIR data, trustworthy digital repositories (TDR), standards, assessment,
  certification, transparency, sustainability  and future project and network routes
  to collaboration and progress. Together these provide an insight to infrastructures
  and institutions seeking to deliver, mature and scale complex services with restrained
  resources. \nAttendees will be provided with insight into the context of this EOSC-A
  task force and its key findings and about how they can engage with and contribute
  to follow up initiatives."
