abstract: 'Platformisation, the centralisation of production, distribution and communication
  means in online platforms, is probably the most impactful evolution in how cultural
  artefacts are created, distributed and preserved in the 21st century. There are
  many platforms with different functions and characteristics, and they have different
  impacts on the production and preservation ecosystem of an artwork. Examples include
  social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter/X which are both a subject
  and medium of art, platforms such as Steam, the App Store or Github which are at
  the core of software distribution, and Discord, Slack or Stack Overflow where discussions
  about games and software-based art happen. Even though these platforms are very
  different, they raise some common concerns for preservation, namely around the dependency
  on an online resource where users have little to no control on the resource''s evolution
  and longevity.

  This is true in both the video game and the software-based art preservation contexts.
  Using the examples of the game TerraTech by Payload Studios, available on Steam,
  and the artwork Go Rando, by artist Ben Grosser,available on Chrome store, this
  presentation uses these two platforms to illustrate how platformisation, and the
  changes it drives in the ecosystems of artworks and videogames affects preservation,
  both positively and negatively. It also asks how practice is changing, or how it
  should be changing, to address these new ecosystems.'
