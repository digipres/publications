abstract: "There’s always something new on the horizon. A new “next big thing”. Some
  whither and die quite rapidly, but some… Some go on to have a significant impact
  on the digital preservation community.\n\nWe’d like to propose a BoF to enable a
  bit of horizon scanning to a) identify ‘the next big thing’ (or things) and how
  it (they) might affect the digital preservation community, and b) what we as a community
  should be doing about it. \n\nPossible contenders for the title include:\n•\t**Environmental
  impact**—There has always been a tension between resource use and preservation,
  especially as the ‘data deluge’ ramps up. Environmental impact adds another facet
  to the argument. We have a responsibility to future generations to preserve information,
  but we also have a responsibility to minimise our impact on the planet. Being able
  to measure that impact and mitigate it is becoming increasingly important.\n•\t**Artificial
  Intelligence**—It’s hard to escape the looming presence of AI. It pops up, wherever
  you look. Does it have a place in digital preservation?\n•\t**Trust**—This has many
  levels of complexity. We’re all familiar with the authenticity problem (how can
  we guarantee that information we’re preserving is the same [or provides the same
  experience] over the long term), but what about the trustworthiness of the information
  in the first place? Is it even our place as curators to question the validity of
  our sources?\n\nWhat else should be on the list?\n\nWe intend to revisit this discussion
  at a future iPRES to see if the collective iPRES brain got it right (2020 hindsight
  is a wonderful thing) and to see what’s changed."
