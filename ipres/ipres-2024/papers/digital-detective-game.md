abstract: "This game is based on the framework of the popular murder mystery game
  Clue (also known as Cluedo outside the United States). Rather than solving a murder
  mystery, players of Digital Detective are trying to find and access a digital record.
  I will create a custom board, adapted from the Clue/Cluedo mansion, and 3D-print
  new pieces for each player to use in the game. \n\nThe goal of the game is to educate
  those not familiar with the challenges of digital preservation about the basic aspects
  that inform the work of preserving and providing access to born-digital records.
  Each player will be attempting to determine three important facts about the digital
  record they are looking for: its physical media type, its file format, and applicable
  access approach. Using the familiar mechanism of deduction used in the popular Clue/Cluedo
  game, players will learn about each of these aspects. \nI envision this game being
  used as an outreach tool for helping people learn about the work required to preserve
  and provide access to born-digital records, prompting the curiosity of the players
  and encouraging them to dig into the deeper details of archivists and those dedicated
  to digital preservation."
