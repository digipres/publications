abstract: 'The Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) is the largest collective health
  research institution in Brazil and the largest manufacturer and supplier of vaccines
  in the country for the Unified Health System (SUS). As a strategic public institution
  for the Brazilian State and of excellence in the area of research, Fiocruz is proud
  and honored with its commitment to being a fundamental agent in the creation, execution
  and innovation of public health policies.

  Scientific and technological communication and information in health are understood
  and treated by the institution as unconditional human right to guarantee development,
  progress and reduce existing inequalities in Brazilian society. In this sense, the
  foundation''s Institute of Scientific and Technological Communication and Information
  in Health (ICICT) credits audiovisual with a central role in the dissemination of
  information, in addition to being an agent for building the memory of Brazilian
  public health. Through the Digital Preservation Program, Fiocruz has been developing
  studies and strategies for preserving audiovisual collections with the aim of consolidating
  the guidelines and objectives contained in its institutional policies: disseminating
  the knowledge produced by the institution, preserving and providing (open) access
  for a long period of time to its valuable audiovisual heritage in Health.

  In this sense, VideoSaúde Distribuidora da Fiocruz advanced in the consolidation
  of a preservation ecosystem based on recommendations and guidance from the OAIS
  reference model,focusing on the application of PREMIS metadata to support the processes
  of digitization and preservation management audiovisual heritage of the institution.

  VideoSaúde is developing a Preservation Management System (SGP-VSD) that integrates
  with the Archivematica preservation software. This integration aims to enable control
  of the digitization flow of your physical collection (magnetic tapes of various
  formats) with recording metadata of the digitization process history and extraction
  of technical metadata, as well as the import of existing descriptive metadata about
  the materials to be be digitized, with the aim of creating robust, reliable and
  interoperable OAIS information packages, ensuring the preservation of this valuable
  cultural heritage of Brazilian science and public health.'
