abstract: "This lightning talk will highlight the results and lessons learned from
  the GIVE project. In this project, meemoo processed 170.000 hours of audiovisual
  archives using speech-to-text, named entity recognition and face recognition. We
  created time-based metadata identifying people, locations and organisations in audio
  and video. Where possible, metadata are linked to open linked authorities, such
  as wikidata. Over 120 partners were involved in the project, from various sectors
  such as digital heritage, city archives, museums and political archives. Part of
  this talk will be dedicated to how we involved these partners into the new but also
  very challenging field of creating metadata through AI. \n\nThe lightning talk is
  not intended as a deep dive into technical matters. We will highlight the obtained
  results and discuss the quality of obtained result. But more importantly, we will
  explain why and how we decided to build certain components, such as face recognition,
  while opting to procure speech-to-text and NER services. This should give the audience
  an idea of the decision processes behind working with AI tooling to create descriptive
  metadata. We will also briefly touch the ethical and legal challenges we encountered,
  share insights that came out of the project.\n\nLastly we will end the talk by looking
  at the future and share the questions that we still have and need to tackle next.
  We hope this will provide inspiration for discussions with the iPRES community during
  the conference."
