abstract: "This talk illustrates a case study of working with removable digital media
  previously stored in far-from-ideal conditions, in a small archives with minimal
  resources. The process included physical cleaning of disks, and resulted in over
  90% of data being recovered and preserved. \n\nThe preservation of born-digital
  materials begins well before they reach any archival institution. Records created
  in the 1990s and 2000s are often “saved” on removable storage media by their creators,
  and the longevity of those media is affected by their storage conditions. Institutions
  collecting private records must deal with these effects only at the time the records
  come to us.\n\nIn 2023, the Lakehead University Archives began acquiring records
  donated by Steve Mantis, a long-time activist and advocate for the rights of injured
  and disabled workers. The records in his fonds reflect close to 40 years of organising.
  \n\nMantis’s records were stored in a hand-built outbuilding on his rural property.
  This two-story structure serves as a garage and home office, and is not insulated,
  heated, or air conditioned. There has been no water damage, and excellent air circulation
  has prevented any mould or mustiness. However, records in the building have been
  subjected to significant temperature swings (over a possible range of 80 degrees
  celsius) and insects have not been excluded.\n\nThe donation of records included
  just under 200 floppy disks. Work began with a full cleaning of all disks, including
  moving and checking under the shutters. Cobwebs and insect remains were removed
  carefully. Only then was it possible to transfer the information from the disks
  and prepare SIPs for ingest. Despite the storage environment, most disks were still
  in good condition. \n\nDigital preservation may often be talked about in the abstract,
  but case-studies like this demonstrate the very real material and practical challenges
  to preservation that are faced by small archives that comprise an important piece
  of local and regional heritage. This case also demonstrates how removable digital
  media may be more resilient to temperature extremes and other environmental challenges
  than one might expect."
