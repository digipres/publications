abstract: "Creating a digital preservation program from scratch involves many components,
  from establishing program scope to implementing preservation strategies. Keeping
  track of documentation and to-dos is challenging in the early stages of program
  development. \n\nWorkflows, traditionally seen as documentation tools, offer a unique
  solution for tracking the development of digital preservation programs. Instead
  of viewing workflows as static documents, they can be transformed into dynamic roadmaps
  that guide practitioners through the program’s inception and evolution.  By crafting
  bespoke, high-level workflows tailored to individual institutional contexts, practitioners
  can effectively use them as planning tools. These workflows serve not only as project
  management tools to track progress but also help effectively communicate with program
  stakeholders. \n\nWorkflows were used in planning Acadia University’s digital preservation
  program. The development of an ingest workflow identified key components of digital
  preservation, including ensuring authenticity, fixity, processing, and transfer
  into long-term storage. Identifying these components ensured tools were procured
  that adequately addressed ingest requirements. Sharing practical lessons learned
  through utilizing workflows in the planning stages of creating a new digital preservation
  program allows for other institutions to follow a similar process. Workflows, policy,
  and implementation are interrelated, and focusing on workflows highlighted priorities
  for Acadia’s policy development. Workflow planning allows small institutions to
  implement realistic digital preservation programs."
