abstract: The transition to digital marketing has revolutionized advertising, reflecting
  and shaping societal norms and trends. The “Saving Ads” project addresses the challenges
  of preserving these ephemeral digital artifacts, essential for understanding the
  evolution of advertising and its socio-cultural impact. The initiative focuses on
  technical solutions for archiving dynamic online ads and enhancing access to these
  critical resources for future scholarship. By examining the preservation of online
  advertisements and suggesting improved approaches for archiving dynamic online content,
  this project contributes to the documentation of digital history.
