abstract: "At the National Library of New Zealand and Archives New Zealand, the Utaina
  project undertakes the task to digitise 70,000 audiovisual items between 2020 and
  2025, to digitally preserve collections and holdings that are stored on historical
  and now \nobsolete at-risk magnetic media formats. \n\nAt this scale, the project
  confronts the pragmatic realities of digital preservation, where decisions are shaped
  by budget, time and resource constraints, while balancing the needs and sustainability
  of long-term preservation. This lightning talk delves into how these factors shaped
  our choices in formats, workflow designs and automation. It will also identify future
  opportunities where AI can be used to improve the digitised files and create new
  avenues for preservation and access to cultural heritage and government records."
