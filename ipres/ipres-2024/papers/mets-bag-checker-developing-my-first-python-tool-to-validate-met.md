abstract: "METS is a metadata standard for packaging all metadata required for the
  description of a digital object. It provides metadata elements for managing Information
  Packages fixity, in the same way as BagIt. Unfortunately, no common rules defining
  how to use it to check the Information Package fixity were adopted.\n\nIn an attempt
  to both learn python and create a - possibly - useful tool, I created a [METS-bag
  checker][1] that can validate METS packages. The talk will present the tool as a
  proof-of-concept, the additional conventions and constraints to METS in order to
  use it as a basic packaging format, and will touch upon developing nice tools with
  a beginner's knowledge of python.\n\n\n  [1]: https://framagit.org/BCaron/mets-bag-checker"
