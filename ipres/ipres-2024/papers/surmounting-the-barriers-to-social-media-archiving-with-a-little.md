abstract: "Social media platforms have become integral to contemporary communication,
  serving as vital records of societal, cultural, and political discourse. However,
  digital preservation professionals face significant challenges in archiving this
  content. This \"Birds of a Feather\" session aims to bring together digital archivists,
  researchers, and allied professionals to discuss these barriers and explore collaborative
  strategies for advocating change.\n\nCurrent legal restrictions, such as platform
  terms of service that prohibit web scraping and API limitations, hinder the ability
  to capture and preserve social media content for research and cultural heritage
  purposes. These restrictions even extend to archiving government information shared
  through official social media accounts. In this session, we will facilitate discussions
  on specific barriers including but not limited to the legal, ethical, policy-related,
  practical, technological and organisational contexts of social media archiving in
  research and cultural heritage institutions. We will also share experiences navigating
  these challenges, as well as brainstorm advocacy strategies to tackle these barriers
  and change the existing framework. \n\nWe aim to engage a diverse group of representative
  stakeholders and experts, including archivists and digital preservation professionals
  from academic institutions, government bodies, and (private) cultural heritage organisations,
  as well as researchers, legal experts, and technologists. Even though the framework
  for social media archiving is embedded in the local context (due to national laws,
  institutional preferences etc.), participants from all over the world are welcome
  to participate to share experiences and solutions and/or bring creativity to the
  table to brainstorm together in a highly interactive session. \n\nWe hope to foster
  a sense of community and shared purpose among participants. Ideal outcomes include
  plans for drafting position papers or best practices, a short report on the current
  state of the art of social media archiving for archival and research purposes and
  increased motivation to advocate for change within participants' respective institutions
  and professional networks."
