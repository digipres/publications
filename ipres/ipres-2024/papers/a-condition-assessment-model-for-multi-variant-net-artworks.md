abstract: 'This paper proposes a methodology for evaluating the condition of multi-variant
  net artworks using Rhizome’s Emulation as a Service (EaaS) infrastructure. The proposed
  three-stage cyclical workflow involves: 1. The collection of evidence of the artwork’s
  intended performance from existing variants, literature, artist interviews, and
  data analysis, 2. Building reference variants in EaaS based on the evidence, and
  3. The comparison of existing and reference variants’ performances and the documentation
  of observations in a relational database.


  The condition reporting methodology developed from this research revealed a practical
  documentation framework for managing information regarding complex multi-variant
  networked digital artworks, using a relational database. This dynamic, open-ended,
  and cyclical workflow is consistent with the in-process nature of net art and its
  intrinsic focus on access and performance indicates its potential for an all-encompassing
  preservation approach.


  A version of the database was implemented at Rhizome and is now being applied to
  their artwork ingestion and documentation process'
