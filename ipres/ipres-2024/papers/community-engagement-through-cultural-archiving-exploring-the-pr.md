abstract: 'This article responds to the calls of Evangelestia-Dougherty, Williams,
  and Punzalan, and elaborates on Bastian’s model of cultural archiving to broaden
  and deepen practices of community-based archiving. Through literature and case-study
  research into cultural archival practices in Flanders (Belgium), this article explores
  the ontological conditions preceding the practice of institutional cultural archiving.
  Recommendations are formulated to develop a community-oriented institutional archival
  practice that is responsive to how cultural memory operates, to what constitutes
  the community record, and to the need to not only talk with communities but also
  to engage in connection between communities.


  Three insights are presented. Firstly, the strategy of community-based archiving
  needs to incorporate the model of cultural archiving, emphasizing the ‘archiving’
  of the community record. Secondly, a relevant and proactive institutional attitude
  is required that focusses through outreach on the boundary-spanning capacities of
  the community record, rather than on strengthening the boundary markers. Finally,
  an institutional cultural archival praxis is perceived as a laboratory for discussing
  perspectives on the making of memory and meaning, with a focus on intercommunity
  and intercultural recognition. Since these preconditions for implementing such a
  praxis are not yet met in the field, this article refrains from concrete techno-practical
  discussions but encourages further research and practical experiments.


  The author of this article is employed at a local public archival institution in
  a small to medium-sized city in the Flemish region of Belgium. Additionally, the
  author is affiliated with the University of Antwerp, where he works on a dissertation
  on the role of archives in society. From the positioning that public institutional
  archival institutions have a societal responsibility, the article focuses on the
  practical implementation of the calls made by Evangelestia-Dougherty, Williams,
  and Punzalan'
