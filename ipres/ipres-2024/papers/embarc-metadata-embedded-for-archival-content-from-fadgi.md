abstract: 'embARC (metadata embedded for archival content) is a free, open source
  application that enables users to manage (i.e., audit, validate and correct) embedded
  metadata in DPX files as individual files or an entire DPX sequence as well as RDD
  48 compliant MXF files, while not impacting the image data. Recent updates include
  the incorporation of accessibility features and FFV1.


  We''ll demo embARC''s metadata submission, editing and validation features and especially
  highlight efforts to improve digital accessibility for open source digital preservation
  software applications as detailed in FADGI''s Accessibility Evaluation Report: Research
  and Improvements for FADGI Open-Source Software Applications (https://www.digitizationguidelines.gov/guidelines/accessibilty_software.html).


  embARC supported by FADGI and is available as a Windows/Mac GUI as well as CLI (https://www.digitizationguidelines.gov/guidelines/embARC.html)'
