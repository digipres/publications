abstract: "This lightening talk will update the audience on our progress in creating
  and using Digital Preservation Plans at the World Bank Group (WBG) Archives. This
  builds on our panel presentation delivered at iPRES 2023. The WBG Archives has a
  backlog exceeding 50 terabytes of born-digital records awaiting ingest into our
  Digital Preservation Platform. To coordinate and prioritize the ingest of these
  materials, we have aligned our Digital Preservation Plans approach with a detailed
  catalog of the backlog materials.  \n\nClear identification of the source and type
  of records in our backlog, combined with the detailed analysis and decisions required
  to create the Digital Preservation Plans, has resulted in an ability to streamline
  tackling the backlogged materials with confidence that we have done our due diligence
  before ingest. In addition, it has provided us with clear evidence as to which Digital
  Preservation Plans we need to create next.\n\nThis lightening talk seeks to give
  a glimpse behind the scenes to the work that needs to be done before our digital
  records can be ingested with real world examples and some suggestions of techniques
  that may aid others in a similar position."
