abstract: "This lightning talk is a continuation of a presentation at the Council
  of Prairie and Pacific University Libraries’ Digital Stewardship Community Digital
  Preservation Mixer in April 2024. The talk will focus on the learning curve of preserving
  large born digital and digitized Audio Visual (AV) records. This lightning talk
  will focus on the theme of “Start 2 Preserve” - how to create the bridge between
  best practices and real-world projects.  \n\nThis presentation will explore the
  results of a preservation pilot project for a collection of 14,430 AV records. From
  metadata cleanup to the creation of an assessment tool for selecting records for
  digitization, to determining standards for digitization of the AV records, creating
  workflows for preparing records for digitization, creation of ingest workflows for
  digitized AV records, and all the steps in-between.  \n\nI hope to answer the question
  of: You have identified and digitized high priority AV records for preservation.
  How do you preserve 10, 20, 30+ TB of digitized AV records with limited resources?
  \ \n\nI hope to provide insight into my learning curve jumping into a large AV preservation
  project, focusing on the challenges surrounding large record storage options for
  a Medium Sized University Archives. I’m hoping to connect with others who can share
  experience scaling up storage solutions for large born digital and digitized records.
  \ \n\nThis lightning talk will include lessons learned about Cloud storage over
  the past ten months of researching best options for born digital and digitized record
  storage. The lightning talk will include recommendations for storage of large AV
  records and lessons learned along the way."
