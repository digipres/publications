abstract: 'The poster of the METS Editorial Board will give an overview of the Metadata
  Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS) with a focus on the new version 2.


  The poster will show the structure of a METS 2 document describing a typical digital
  object from an institutional repository. The example will include content files
  such as a PDF, a PDF/A object, and an associated data set, as well as metadata associated
  with the content such as descriptive Dublin Core metadata, technical metadata about
  the PDF, and preservation metadata (PREMIS) describing the PDF to PDF/A transformation.
  This will show how METS can easily represent multiple versions of the same underlying
  data, how METS can link between content and its related metadata, and convey that
  METS 2 is a useful way to structure digital objects.


  We will also show an overview of major changes from METS 1 to METS 2, using the
  same example as above. This will convey that METS 2 is simpler to implement and
  more consistent than METS 1, as well as provide a sense of the changes to those
  that may have some familiarity with METS 1.


  Finally, we will provide an overview of the resources available to aid in implementation
  of METS 2, such as documentation, examples, and aids to migration. The goal is to
  convey that METS 2 is modern and well-supported and that users can find sufficient
  resources and guides for implementation.'
