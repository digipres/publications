abstract: 'The National Library of France (BnF) has been running a multi-purpose preservation
  system as soon as May 2010. Since then, it had to adapt for internal growth with
  the arrival of many different kinds of material and the management of hardware renewal.


  In 2018, the merge with the audiovisual repository forces the team to find innovative
  ways to handle this whole new class of materials and still keep with the regular
  operations.


  Two recurring themes that arise across all these events is the need for abstracting
  and for partitioning both the storage and the work to be done on data. This kind
  of strategy allows for managing growth and change without losing too much of oneâ€™s
  mind.'
