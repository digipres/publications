abstract: "In this workshop we will enable participants to plan a project to estimate
  the carbon footprint of their digital archive. We will share how the CLOCKSS archive
  approached this, including how and when we engaged key stakeholders along the way,
  and explore ways that this could be generalised to be more broadly applicable throughout
  the international digital preservation community.\n\nCLOCKSS began by setting out
  to find friends who could help us find a path. We were so lucky to find colleagues
  involved in the DIMPACT Project (https://dimpact.org/about). The DIMPACT community
  is focused on calculating and ultimately reducing the carbon footprint of digital
  communication and media companies and includes publishers such as Cambridge University
  Press, Elsevier, Institute of Physics Publishing, Oxford University Press, and Taylor
  & Francis.\n\nWe began by developing a component/functional map of our digital archive,
  and documenting:\n1) The component parts of the system \n2) At a high level, how
  these components work \n3) How and where the service is used\n\nOur aim was to unpack
  the ‘preservation’ black box that was part of the broader DIMPACT project diagram
  for all of digital publishing. \n \nThe next step was to:\n \n1.     Identify the
  significant energy-using components used to provide, maintain and deliver the preservation
  service and where each component was geographically located. For example, CLOCKSS
  securely preserves content in 11 different universities located in 7 countries.\n\n2.
  \   Identify how the preservation service is used, e.g. by how many users, the quantity
  or duration of service used per user, what devices the service is consumed on, what
  proportions of users use what kinds of devices, where the service is used (e.g.
  university, office, or home), etc. \n\nFor each system component we then gathered
  relevant data (e.g. electricity source carbon intensities and usage and volumes
  of data transferred).\n\nFinally, the carbon footprint will be estimated and we
  will be armed with the information to understand where and how we can make changes
  to reduce this. \n\nNow it is time to find friends, including those in the Digital
  Preservation Coalition, so that we can continue the journey together!"
