abstract: "**Abstract**\nIn response to the growing need for inclusivity within the
  international digital preservation community, the proposed mini-conference FRiPRES,
  aims to bridge language barriers and enhance participation among French-speaking
  professionals. This initiative seeks to serve as a preliminary, French-speaking
  segment of the larger International iPRES, making the event more appealing to French
  spoken participants.\nFRiPRES offers a platform where French-speaking archivists,
  librarians, and digital preservationists can engage in meaningful dialogue and exchange
  knowledge in their native language. By hosting presentations and discussions in
  French, it will lower linguistic hurdles, fostering understanding and collaboration
  within the community. This approach not only encourages participation in the FRiPRES
  sessions but also aims to motivate attendees to remain for the entire duration of
  iPRES.\n\n**Proposed Agenda**\nWe propose to organize that francophone event just
  before the iPres conference on Monday 16/09. \n\nThe afternoon program will feature
  presentations from prominent figures : \n - Arnaud HULSTAERT from SMALS will discuss
  the intricacies of managing\n   'ARCHIVING-AS-A-SERVICE'. (https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnaud-hulstaert/)\n
  - Marion VILLE will share insights from the innovative Vitam project in France.
  (https://www.linkedin.com/in/marion-ville-10a96546/ )\n\nWe envisage the involvement
  of institutions as the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF) and a notable organization
  from Quebec to enriches the discourse. A public call for participation can also
  be organized for this event of the iPres conference.\n\n**Infotel involvement dedicated
  to the community:**  \nInfotel will sponsor this event, participants will enjoy
  complimentary food (fries) and beverages, ensuring a comfortable and conducive environment
  for learning. Infotel will also organize the agenda and manage the activities for
  this half-day event, facilitating a seamless and engaging experience for all. \nAdditionally,
  FRiPRES will be accessible to a broader audience through the provision of original
  presentations alongside translated slides, ensuring that the insights and knowledge
  shared are not confined by language barriers. This strategic dissemination of content
  aims to expand the reach and impact of digital preservation discussions, ultimately
  leading to a more interconnected and robust international community.\nThis initiative
  represents a crucial step towards democratizing knowledge access in digital preservation,
  aligning with iPRES’s mission to foster global collaboration and knowledge exchange
  in the field."
