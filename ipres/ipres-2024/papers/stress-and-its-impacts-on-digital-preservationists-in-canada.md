abstract: 'This poster would illustrate a few of the key findings of a research study
  that seeks to investigate the impacts role-based stress is having on the health
  and well-being of the digital preservationist community in Canada.  The purpose
  of the study is to identify and rank the common stressors facing digital preservationists;
  identify correlations between stressors, working conditions, and other demographics;
  and explore whether there is evidence to support the theory that the inherent challenges
  of digital preservation (e.g. volume of work, fragility/ephemerality of the materials,
  rapid technological obsolescence, lack of available resources, etc.) are contributing
  to burnout and/or anxiety/depression among digital preservationists.


  A survey was distributed to the Canadian digital preservationist community asking
  respondents questions about the stressors related to the components of their digital
  preservation programs; stress related to their use of technology; the impacts of
  their roles as digital preservationists on their stress and anxiety levels; their
  satisfaction with their jobs; their susceptibility to burnout; and their perceptions
  of their levels of generalized stress and anxiety. Respondents were also asked to
  identify their mood as well as any symptoms related to anxiety/depression that may
  have recently resulted from the stress of their work. Additional questions pertaining
  to age, gender, employment, and working conditions were also posed to respondents.


  The survey data was then analyzed by University of Winnipeg Masterâ€™s of Development
  Practice (Indigenous Development) students in their Quantitative Research Methods
  class.  Students were asked to respond to selected research questions and create
  data visualizations illustrating their findings.  This poster would share and build
  upon some of those data visualizations, with the permissions of the students, in
  determining key study findings such as the correlations between demographics/work-related
  characteristics, stressors, role conflict/ambiguity/overload, technostress, and
  mental health. While the poster would be particular to the Canadian environment,
  the data would potentially highlight a social concern that may be prevalent amongst
  the international digital preservation community.'
