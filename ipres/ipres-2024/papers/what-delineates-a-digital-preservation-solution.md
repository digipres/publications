abstract: "We at Jisc have recently had the need to specify a base set of requirements
  for our newly launched Digital Preservation DPS (https://www.jisc.ac.uk/digital-preservation-systems-dynamic-purchasing-system-dps).
  This core set of requirements was based upon the requirements in the DPC’s procurement
  toolkit (https://www.dpconline.org/digipres/implement-digipres/core-requirements-for-a-digital-preservation-system).
  In the course of our discussions, when identifying the requirements, the question
  of a definition of a digital preservation solution arose. There are many definitions
  of digital preservation (my favourite short one is “keeping digital stuff usable”),
  but none for a digital preservation solution (at least not that I’ve found). A facetious
  response could be “A digital preservation solution enables you to keep digital stuff
  usable”, but that’s not really very helpful when it comes to procuring a system.
  \n\nSo, what defines a digital preservation solution? We know it’s a sliding scale
  (with very blurred lines). Most would probably agree that backup isn’t digital preservation,
  but what about dark archives? They keep stuff usable in the short term, but without
  format migration could they really be described as proper digital preservation?
  Are there other decision points/getaways where on the one side there are systems
  that are digital preservation solutions and on the other side there are systems
  that don’t make the grade - sheep on the right, goats on the left.\n\nWe're interested
  in the communities take on this. Many people have strong opinions around definitions.
  This BoF session would be your chance to surface your opinion and “persuade” others
  to adopt your point of view."
