abstract: 'The DiSHACLed project aims to enhance data governance efficiency within
  the European data ecosystem by leveraging the Shapes Constraints Language (SHACL).
  The project focuses on three key data governance tasks: dataset discovery, interoperable
  tooling, and automated form generation. Flanders, a front-runner in adopting SHACL,
  provides a unique testing ground for these innovations.


  The European Data Governance Act (DGA) seeks to promote fair and equitable data
  usage, enhance trust in data sharing, and establish a framework for data governance
  within the EU. Flanders, with its OSLO programme defining over 134 ratified semantic
  standards, is well-positioned to address data governance challenges through Linked
  Data technologies.


  ##Project Goals:

  1. Data Discovery: Develop an algorithm for efficient dataset discovery using SHACL
  shapes, reducing discovery time from days to seconds. This will be piloted in at
  least two data portals, targeting a discovery rate of 20 datasets per second.

  2. Interoperable Tooling: Create an automation strategy for connecting different
  data processors across project partners Sirus, Inuits, and Redpencil. This involves
  developing a shared specification for interoperable workflows, allowing seamless
  data integration and processing.

  3. Automated Form Generation: Generate web forms for data collection automatically
  using SHACL shapes. This aims to cover 80% of existing data types, significantly
  reducing the manual effort required for form creation.


  The project will culminate in a proof-of-concept map displaying traffic measurements
  across Flanders, showcasing the automated selection and integration of datasets
  based on SHACL shapes. This demonstrator will highlight the efficiency and scalability
  of the developed solutions. During this talk, we will go over the project goals
  in detail and explain the methodologies and strategies we are employing to achieve
  these research objectives. We will also discuss the specific technical challenges
  we face and how we will overcome them, providing a comprehensive overview of our
  approach and findings.'
