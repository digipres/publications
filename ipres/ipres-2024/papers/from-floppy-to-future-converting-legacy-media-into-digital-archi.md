abstract: 'This is a tutorial by AIDA, a consortium of heritage institutions focused
  on preserving and providing access to digital private archives. Through collaboration
  and resource sharing, AIDA develops strategies and solutions for this purpose.


  Since the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, vast amounts of data have been
  stored on digital media like floppy disks, zip disks, and jaz disks. Modern workstations
  often cannot read them. This threatens data loss for every heritage organisation,
  from national archives to local historical societies.


  Migrating data from outdated to modern storage media is complex, and not all organisations
  can set up a capture station for different digital media types on their own. They
  must first locate suitable legacy reading equipment and then connect it to modern
  workstations. Additionally, they need software to transfer the complete contents
  of the media to contemporary storage without alterations.


  AIDA Capture-Lab

  ----------------


  The AIDA Capture-Lab is operated from the meemoo offices in Ghent and provides an
  obsolete data carrier capture service available for cultural heritage organisations.
  The capture lab was founded by AIDA in 2019 as a result of the [Digital Repair Cafe
  project](https://meemoo.be/en/projects/digital-repair-cafe). By bringing together
  and sharing resources and knowledge, data transfer is much more efficient and sustainable.
  All workflows and setups are documented on the [AIDA Capture Lab website](https://automatic-ingest-digital-archives.github.io/Digital-Repair-Cafe/).


  RODA-In

  -------


  We demonstrate the process of using RODA-In to convert digital archival data into
  Submission Information Packages (SIPs) for ingestion into e-depots.


  RODA-In is a free and open-source tool which creates SIPs from local files and folders
  and offers features such as:

  - creating, loading, and editing classification schemas;

  - automatic association of files/folders and metadata with SIP;

  - definition of metadata templates;

  - support for various metadata formats (EAD, DC, etc.);

  - creating SIPs in various formats.


  AIDA hands-on

  -------------


  In this tutorial, we will illustrate how to retrieve data from outdated digital
  media and package it into SIPs. We encourage active participation by having the
  audience bring their legacy media to retrieve and package data into a SIP alongside
  us.'
