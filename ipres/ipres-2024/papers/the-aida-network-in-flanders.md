abstract: The text discusses the formation and activities of AIDA, a Flemish network
  focused on digital preservation challenges. It outlines the network's inception,
  its response to the growing volume of digital archival materials, and its particular
  focus on Digital Private Archives and Collections (DPAC). AIDA's projects, such
  as the Digital Repair Cafe and SCALA emphasize the need for practical experience
  and collaboration. The article also highlights the organizational, business, and
  technical aspects of AIDA's solution, based on open-source principles. Lessons learned
  include the importance of practical experience through small projects, effective
  communication in a cooperative model, and the significance of understanding both
  technical and organizational aspects. The AIDA solution encompasses a business plan
  and technical workflows, contributing to the broader cultural heritage sector by
  promoting digital preservation awareness and collaboration. The article concludes
  by emphasizing technical knowledge, organizational aspects, and the success of cooperative
  efforts in preserving digital archives.
