abstract: 'The DigiPres Workbench is a new set of practical tools created by the Registries
  of Good Practice project. One part of this is the Collection Profile tool, which
  allows you to compare the format profile of your own collection with that of other
  institutions, and with the contents of the various format registries that are out
  there.


  This demonstration will show the tools in use, by examining the contents of the
  iPRES Pantry. Which format registries and tools could provide the best coverage?
  How representative is the Pantry? Do real digital collections look the same? Come
  along and find out!'
