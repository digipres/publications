abstract: This paper will examine the potential for retrieving and indexing saved
  executable states and input replays through web browser integration. It explores
  the emerging possibilities and limitations of executable citation through a discussion
  of the current development of the Game and Interactive Software Scholarship Toolkit
  (GISST). GISST is designed to allow for users to load emulators locally in a web
  browser and then record and retrieve both emulated system states and input recordings
  of system interactions. These references can then be embedded as links within scholarly
  works and online documents, or directed executed as objects running withing standard
  HTML elements. The goal of this work is to elaborate on how executable citation
  can enable easier access to emulation for both researchers and practitioners, along
  with how these types of references can enable new forms of scholarship and clarify
  aspects of software object description relative to emulated contexts. Keywords â€“
  emulation, citation, computational state, software studies, software preservation
