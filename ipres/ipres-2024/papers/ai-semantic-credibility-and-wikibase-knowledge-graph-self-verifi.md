abstract: We introduce a chat bot tailored to the domain of digital preservation that
  makes use of  artificial intelligence (AI) as well as structured data from the Wikidata
  knowledge base. Our choice to leverage data from Wikidata in order to provide verified
  responses to questions related to the domain of computing increases the transparency
  of our chat bot. In response to the frequency of LLM hallucination, when models
  provide inaccurate but plausible responses, we generated a list of questions people
  may have about file formats and software. We posed a series of prompts to our Wikidata
  AI Digital Preservation Chat Bot (ChatWikiDP) related to file format identification
  and software compatibility. We then checked those responses against statements in
  the Wikidata knowledge base to compare answers. We present a chat bot that combines
  generative language synthesis from LLMs and attributable linked data from Wikidata
  with an interface that supports interactive verification of claims. The combination
  of responses from LLMs and data from knowledge graphs ensure that when we move from
  documents to data, we can retrace our steps from factually accurate information
  to source documents.
