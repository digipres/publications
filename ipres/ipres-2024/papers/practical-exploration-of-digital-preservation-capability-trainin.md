abstract: 'As one of the first teams to conduct digital preservation work in China,
  NDPP is committed to implementing long-term preservation of commercial digital resources
  within the country, raising awareness of digital preservation among relevant institutions
  and the public, and improving digital preservation capabilities. To ensure the reliable
  implementation of NDPP''s preservation work, NDPP is dedicated to building a learning-oriented
  team that can adapt to the evolving technical and skill requirements in digital
  preservation. Therefore, NDPP has established a comprehensive training framework
  encompassing six areas of knowledge content and ten different training activities.
  This framework is designed to provide targeted training for the NDPP work teams
  and to facilitate inter-institute communication and cooperation.

  NDPP analyzed the team''s capability requirements based on the business process
  to form a framework. Based on the survey of the capability backgrounds of team members
  and combined with practical needs, an NDPP digital preservation knowledge system
  covering six areas was built, which included the field of digital preservation knowledge,
  operational skills, technology and development, resource planning and preservation
  rights, communication and collaboration, and continuous learning.

  The training methods include specialized courses for skills and knowledge enhancement,
  academic salons for scholarly discussion, practical simulations for hands-on experience,
  and issue discussions for problem-solving. NDPP also utilizes modern platforms such
  as a WeChat official account for information dissemination and a project website
  for resource sharing, which includes ongoing updates, training materials, and research
  findings. Bi-monthly bulletins and annual research reports are produced to keep
  the team informed of global advancements in the field. At the same time, nationwide
  academic conferences and open days promote broader cooperation and understanding
  of digital preservation. Educational handbooks and promotional materials are produced
  to increase public recognition of the importance of digital preservation.

  Based on this framework, the NDPP has developed a plan for training activities in
  2024, after which feedback will be collected and the framework improved. NDPP will
  continue to expand training for business management teams and strengthen alliance
  cooperation in digital preservation in China.'
