abstract: "This poster will present the development of a collaborative Web Lifecycle
  Management programme at the University of Edinburgh. The University first embarked
  on web archiving through collecting community responses to the Covid-19 pandemic.
  This initiative provided a valuable opportunity to explore closer working with the
  UK Web Archive (UKWA) and to demonstrate the value of web archiving to the digital
  preservation of the institutional record. Further collaboration with the UKWA as
  part of an externally-funded project, Archive of Tomorrow, supported recruitment
  of a dedicated Web Archivist. This increased visibility and capacity allowed the
  University Archives to collaborate more meaningfully with the Website and Communications
  team who support web services for the institution’s many diverse communities. This
  poster will describe this collaboration and the shared roles and responsibilities
  for ensuring a sustainable and effective web service for users, from creation to
  long-term preservation. \n\nThe institutional web estate (both at the main URL and
  thousands of off-domain URLs) encompasses a vast array of valuable resources – from
  press releases to research project websites. In the absence of established pathways
  to the Archives for digital records, web archiving provides a strategy to capture
  some record of almost every activity and function of the institution, all in the
  context of their presence on the Web. This Web Lifecycle programme partners closely
  the UKWA, using their infrastructure and guidance as a core strategy to support
  the preservation of most content in scope. This partnership allows the Archive to
  focus on quality assurance, troubleshooting, and metadata creation, improving the
  existing records in the UKWA and also supporting institutional requirements without
  maintaining a local system or contracting a third-party vendor.  \n\nThis poster
  will discuss the benefits of this collaborative approach to web archiving to meet
  institutional digital preservation requirements. It will also address some of the
  limitations and challenges, such as licencing and aligning information policies
  across a complex, devolved web estate. Ultimately, this poster will demonstrate
  how collaboration – internal and external – has catalysed progress in preserving
  one of the most diverse and inclusive records of activity at a large University
  – its web estate."
