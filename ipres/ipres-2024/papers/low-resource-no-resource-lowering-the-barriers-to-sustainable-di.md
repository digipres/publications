abstract: "Digital preservation knowledge and practice is necessary in all domains
  and professions but is often presumed to take place only within the context of the
  memory or research institution.  If we are to improve digital preservation practice,
  knowledge, funding and awareness, we must broaden our understanding of the current
  state of digital preservation in self-funded and other low-resource contexts. \nThis
  paper presents a detailed case study of one such context, the state of digital preservation
  knowledge and practice within the UK professional artist population. Contrary to
  public belief, artists constitute a highly educated but severely underfunded profession.
  At the same time, artists in contemporary practice are largely dependent for their
  professional survival upon the competent and sustainable preservation and use of
  fragile and valuable digital objects. However, training and sociotechnical support
  infrastructure for this professional domain is conspicuous by its absence. \nThese
  tensions make contemporary professional art practice an ideal site for investigation
  of the barriers to - and benefits of - improved digital preservation practice.  \nThis
  paper provides an overview of current digital preservation practice in this complex
  professional landscape; delivers practical recommendations for consideration by
  the digital preservation community; and demonstrates the value of interdisciplinary
  research in understanding the real barriers to digital preservation – and how we
  may lower them - in a fascinating and often misunderstood profession.\n\nKeywords
  – Digital Preservation, Visual Art, Qualitative Research, Social Science, Advocacy."
