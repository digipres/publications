abstract: 'The preservation of digital cultural heritage demands innovative approaches
  that not only safeguard diverse digital artifacts but also promote their long-term
  accessibility. This talk explores a collaborative initiative undertaken by a consortium
  of NSW Government cultural institutions to develop a system-agnostic Submission
  Information Package (SIP) specification as part of a broader digital preservation
  pilot project. The objective was to establish a unified framework that supports
  interoperability across diverse organisations while accommodating unique preservation
  requirements and metadata standards of each institution as part of a shared digital
  preservation solution.


  Leveraging standards such as the Reference Model for an Open Archival Information
  System (OAIS), PREservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies (PREMIS), and the
  Bagit File Packaging Format, the project aimed to create a common SIP specification
  that could integrate seamlessly with any existing or future digital preservation
  system infrastructure. The development process involved comprehensive stakeholder
  analysis, requirement gathering, iterative design, and pilot testing with datasets
  from participating institutions. Several revisions were made to the original specification
  to better align with practical challenges and feedback from participating institutions.
  This iterative refinement process was crucial to ensuring that the specification
  could effectively handle the diverse nature of digital content and metadata practices
  across different institutions.


  The resulting SIP specification not only streamlined the ingest process but also
  ensured a consistent approach to metadata and digital object management across institutions.
  This talk offers insight into collaborative processes and technical considerations
  crucial for developing shared digital infrastructure.'
