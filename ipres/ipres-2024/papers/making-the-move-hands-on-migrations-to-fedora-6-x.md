abstract: "Fedora is the open-source, digital repository system underpinning a wide
  variety of digital libraries and archives. It is designed to store, manage, and
  preserve digital content and is used by over 300 institutions around the world.
  Fedora has seen iterations over its 20+ year existence, but its core principles,
  focused on long-term digital preservation, have remained the same. Fedora is synonymous
  with stability and has long-remained a household name in the digital repository
  landscape.\n\nThe most recent major version of Fedora, Fedora 6.x, was released
  3 years ago and there has been increasing migration efforts toward 6.x from users
  in outdated and unsupported older versions of the software. Fedora 6.x has sparked
  renewed interest in Fedora implementers because of the choice to incorporate the
  Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) within the persistence layer. Fedora 6.x is being
  well received, and new and unique use cases are being discovered regularly as the
  community continues to expand.\n\nThe Fedora program is committed to supporting
  all migration efforts to 6.x. This workshop will provide a unique opportunity for
  attendees to “bring their own data” and conduct a live migration with the help and
  assistance of the Fedora technical team. Facilitators will work alongside participants
  to provide suggestions, offer best practices, gather use cases, and troubleshoot
  in real-time. While the workshop will be focused on the Fedora migration, if time
  permits (and depending on the complexity of the use cases), facilitators may be
  able to assist with configurations with common front-end solutions like Islandora
  and some Samvera applications. \n\nWorkshop goals and objectives:\nIntroduce and
  familiarize participants with Fedora migration tools and processes.\nProvide hands-on
  migration assistance with real-word data (or sample data if required).\nExecute
  a migration to Fedora 6.x using available tooling and documentation.\nProvide attendees
  with detailed information on available support channels, documentation and where
  and how to seek assistance beyond the workshop.\n\nProposed Workshop Structure:\n1.
  Brief overview of the new features included in Fedora 6.x.\n2. Introduction to Fedora
  6.x migration tooling and documentation.\n3. Open discussion about migration needs,
  use cases, barriers etc.\n4. Facilitation of hands-on Fedora migrations."
