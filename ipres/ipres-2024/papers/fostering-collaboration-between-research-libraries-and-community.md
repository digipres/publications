abstract: 'Despite the potential for mutually beneficial partnerships, collaboration
  between research libraries and community archives in digital preservation remained
  limited. This paper explores four key barriers to collaboration: paternalistic attitudes
  toward community archives, the role of memberships, collection development policies,
  and incompatible digital preservation workflows. Examining real-world examples,
  we demonstrate how these barriers hinder joint efforts to secure long-term accessibility
  of digital materials. The paper concludes by proposing actionable strategies to
  dismantle these barriers and pave the way for a more inclusive and robust digital
  preservation ecosystem—one that fosters collaboration between institutions of all
  sizes and empowers communities to safeguard their digital heritage.'
