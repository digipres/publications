abstract: "AusEaaSI is an Australian consortium of research institutions and organisations
  in the Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAM)\nsector to build a network
  using Emulation-as-a-Service infrastructure (EaaSI) in order to stabilise and provide
  access to culturally significant born-digital artefacts.\n\nIn tandem with this,
  the Archiving Australian Media Arts project is developing a good practice method
  for preserving and emulating historic digital media artworks with special regard
  to artworks that are nteractive, complex digital artefacts, which react and respond
  to the clicks and mouse movements of the user.\nThe collaborative approach and buy-in
  from stakeholders has built a nascent community with the confidence to tackle the
  particular challenges that are entailed in collecting, stabilising and emulating
  complex digital artefacts. No one institution is undertaking this work in isolation;
  rather, they are part of a national digital preservation ecosystem, supported by
  a core research team with high level specialist skills.\n\nA diverse range of case
  studies drawn from exhibitions and the media art collections that have been developing
  across t he Australian cultural institutions partnering this project. These include:
  dLux MediaArts, Experimenta Media Art, ANAT, ACMI, the Art Gallery of New South
  Wales, the State Library of South Australia, and Griffith University Art \nMuseum.\n\nThis
  poster outlines the work that has been achieved creating images from a range of
  media, configuring emulated environments and providing access for archival appraisal
  and public exhibition."
