abstract: 'Emails have become an essential component of the work toolbox of public
  administrations. Archives, tasked with preserving the files of public authorities,
  are therefore confronted with the need to preserve also the emails linked to the
  public tasks of these authorities. The technical challenges surrounding email archiving
  have been long and extensively deliberated. Since 2013, Capstone archiving has emerged
  as a means to efficiently retain the vast amounts of emails sent and received by
  ''key figures'' of public institutions and address deficiencies in manual archiving
  practices. While this approach holds significant promise and is thus being adopted
  or seriously considered by several archives, among which the Belgian State Archives,
  the legal intricacies associated with this approach remain inadequately elucidated.
  Specifically, a deeper examination of the legal ramifications stemming from the
  adoption of this US-origin methodology within the European context seems necessary.


  In our poster, we will assess if and how Capstone can be a viable solution for European
  archives, compliant with legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation
  (GDPR). We look at several possible cases, such as individual versus team mailboxes,
  and different aspects of digital preservation, including consultation of the emails
  in the short and long run. As with most data protection questions, the answers are
  not limited to yes or no but depend on the details of each situation.'
