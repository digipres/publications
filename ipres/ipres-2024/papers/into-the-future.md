abstract: "Into the future\nIn 2024 the digital preservation community can look back
  with pride on what we have achieved. However, new challenges appear on the horizon,
  often originating from areas beyond our profession. We may no longer be able to
  conquer these within the existing preservation community, like we are used to do.
  But perhaps we can find inspiration for new initiatives by looking back at how it
  all started.\nThree decades ago, in 1998, a group of 60 people gathered in Hotel
  dos Templarios in Tomar, Portugal. They arrived from around 20 countries to participate
  in the first international workshop on digital preservation in Europe. The air was
  filled with eagerness and enthusiasm. Everyone felt part of a new and adventurous
  journey: how to preserve electronic (aka digital) heritage.\nThis DELOS 6th workshop
  on Preservation was organized by two (!) projects funded by the European Commission:
  DELOS, consisting of computer scientists and NEDLIB, a project of national libraries.
  Two different worlds coming together in one place.\nThe 15 presenters at the workshop
  spoke on a range of topics, seemingly inspired by the 1996 report of Garrett and
  Waters “Preserving digital information”. On this poster I’ll map these topics to
  the status quo to show the tremendous progress the digital preservation community
  has made. Over time, the heritage organisations involved were able to translate
  the problems into workable solutions. Individual initiatives were connected in collaborative
  projects, initiated and funded by heritage organisations themselves with the support
  of the European Commission, the National Science Foundation and various governments.
  The profession of digital preservation shaped itself.\nThe Tomar workshop started
  with a film “Into the Future. On the preservation of knowledge”. An initiative of
  CLIR, still available on Vimeo. The film aimed to raise awareness, amongst the general
  public and policy makers, of the risk of losing digital information. In just 50
  minutes, broadcast via television, it conveyed the necessity of digital preservation.
  \ \nHow might we grab the attention of today's decision makers in a similarly creative
  way?"
