abstract: "Many born-digital collections are created with access and shareability
  in mind, shaped by varying technical capacity and resources. At the same time, institutional
  moves towards digital submission procedures, e.g. university e-theses, can inadvertently
  encourage compression, encryption, hyperlinked content, and web-optimisation, as
  depositors mitigate upload constraints or rights management in the digital environment.
  \ \n\n \n\nAlthough we can recommend ideals around high quality deposits for preservation
  going forward, how do we address the challenges of our pre-existing digital collections
  and early legacy work? And if we choose to exclude collections based on the unavailability
  of appropriate preservation originals, do we risk creating inequalities that unintentionally
  bias our collections in the long-term, against lower-budget, often arts and humanities,
  and community research?  \n\n  \n\nThis poster visualises some early findings from
  a project looking at e-thesis deposits as a case study for the practical decisions
  needed to balance inclusivity with stakeholder capacity in repository management.
  Data is drawn from a survey and focus groups designed to understand how and why
  depositors select file formats for saving and sharing projects, as well as the practical,
  technical and social implications of this for preservation management of born–digital
  assets. \n\n \n\nThis is the beginning of a year-long project hosted at Queen’s
  University Belfast and facilitated by The National Archives and Research Libraries
  UK as part of their Professional Fellowship programme. Feedback and interaction
  from iPRES attendees is welcomed via zooming, rotation, and annotation features
  enabled by applications such as Spline3D and Sketchfab, to encourage closer viewing
  and ideas sharing, as well as QR codes linking to my project blogs and information."
