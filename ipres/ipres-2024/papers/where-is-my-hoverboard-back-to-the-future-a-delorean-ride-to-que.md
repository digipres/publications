abstract: "Embark on a journey reminiscent of the iconic movie \"Back to the Future\"
  as we explore Queensland State Archives' epic saga of building a digital archive.
  From the humble beginnings of extracting digital legacy records to navigating the
  labyrinth of complex data formats and relationships, our expedition mirrors a voyage
  through time. Arriving at our desired destination, the launch of QSA Digital Archive,
  it's as if we've barely beat the clock.\nLike Marty McFly's quest to alter the future,
  we have challenged conventional thinking, remodelled the way we engage with our
  agencies, reshaped transfer processes and workflows to adapt to the ever-evolving
  landscape of digital preservation and the needs of our users. Along the way, we
  have recalibrated our assumptions and questioned the very feasibility of transfers
  themselves, grappling with the reality of preserving our digital heritage in a rapidly
  changing world. \nAs we reflect on our odyssey, we ponder: is this the future we
  envisioned when we embarked on our quest to safeguard our digital legacy, or do
  we fear that the legacy will become lost to the memories of future generations despite
  our ambitions? \nAs we navigate the digital archive time machine to explore the
  agency landscape, are we encountering confidence and readiness to confront the challenges
  ahead? The digital preservation maturity of our agencies varies significantly, ranging
  from struggles in identifying permanent digital records to grappling with creators
  of large, complex datasets that exceed the capabilities of this iteration of the
  digital archive.\nJoin us as we delve into these questions and envision the path
  forward in preserving Queensland's digital heritage for generations to come.  By
  harnessing the power of technology, embracing interdisciplinary approaches, and
  fostering a culture of preservation, our mission is to build archives that stand
  the test of time."
