abstract: 'This paper gives a short overview of Keepers registry and describes two
  use cases for interacting with the registry: (1) using it to query data and crosscheck
  it against institutional holdings to prioritize holdings for in-house digital preservation
  (2) reporting archival holdings back to Keepers Registry to make institutional preservation
  activities transparent. Though Keepers registry has been available since 2013, few
  use case descriptions of how to interact with the registry exist. The paper describes
  the use cases in the context of TIB’s digital preservation processes and outlines
  solutions found and challenges encountered. It concludes with an outlook to further
  work for TIB’s workflows as well as for an e-journal preservation registry in general.'
