abstract: 'Digital Preservation for 5 Year Olds is a set of dfinition cards with a
  difference. We have asked Chat GPT-4 to explain the concepts as if to a 5 year old.
  This means that it is an excellent tool for both learning new concepts and for more
  experienced practitioners to consider advocacy and how concepts can be easily understood.


  The game currently has three different variants dependent on competitive or collaborative
  game play and the number of people involved. The game dynamic can start with a basic
  matching game but can be changed to be more competitive or a ''who am I?'' style
  of game. We are planning for the conference to expand the number of variants with
  a prioritisation dynamic, for example what would different practitioners value or
  prioritize most out of the different definitions. The hope is to encourage conversations
  about these concepts in practice amongst the players.


  The game has been tested and well received in local games events as well as at the
  ICA Congress 2023.


  While the game is already created, as the title suggests, we are currently working
  on related expansion packs. These are archival theory, storage media and policies.


  We are hoping to use the session to not only play the card games, but also explore
  what else the cards could do. If willing we will even encourage participants to
  make up their own rules.'
