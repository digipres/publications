abstract: "**Focus of my contribution**\nIn examining the procedures for managing
  digital archives, the poster will take a closer look at the challenges of preserving
  and providing emails. The issue is currently under discussion at an international
  level (e.g. DeBauche et al., 2023 [iPRES], regarding French institutions: Ville,
  2023). Even in German-speaking countries there are studies focussing on specific
  issues (e.g. Benauer, 2022), but comprehensive research addressing the various challenges
  has yet to be conducted.\n\n**Study** \nTaking this situation into account, I sent
  out an online-questionnaire in April 2024 to the specialist communities of Germany,
  Austria, Switzerland and Luxembourg. Distribution channels were six relevant mailing
  lists. The survey provides the data basis for my current master's thesis (submission
  in June 2024 in Library and Information Science, Humboldt University of Berlin).
  The aim is to determine the current challenges and perspectives of email processing.
  187 participants voted, of which 115 questionnaires are evaluable. Challenges were
  captured with qualitative methods (survey coding). \n\n**Objective of the poster
  contribution**\nI would like to present the results at iPRES and also involve the
  international community. I aim to enhance participation with an interactive poster
  that includes a Mentimeter survey. This will not only provide insights into the
  unique challenges of email archiving in German-speaking countries but also extend
  the discussion to the international community, fostering a dialogue for making informed,
  long-term decisions in the field.\n\nNo specialised knowledge is required. Participants
  will need a smart device to fully engage with the interactive elements of the poster.\n\n----------\nLiterature
