abstract: "In the leadup to the launch of its digital preservation system, the Records
  Management (RM) department of the National Archives of Singapore (NAS) is reviewing
  its current digital preservation operations to identify steps that could be taken
  to enable the operations to be scaled up.\n \nThe RM department oversees the digital
  preservation of government records transferred to NAS. In general, preservation-related
  decisions are currently recorded by the department in the following manner:\n \n1.
  \    Formal documentation containing instructions or high-level policy tailored
  for communication to government agencies. – Only major decisions are generally recorded
  while minor decisions and contextual information deemed unsuitable or irrelevant
  for external communication are usually excluded.\n \n2.     Emails documenting decisions
  on specific activities or actions. – Easily lost as emails accumulate over time
  and emails containing decisions are mingled with emails which do not.\n \nTo ensure
  that there is a more structured framework to document decisions, NAS is currently
  piloting a documentation framework for digital preservation. Decisions made during
  preservation activities are recorded using a template based on the Architectural
  Decision Record (ADR) methodology. Where a decision is important enough that a higher-level
  policy or workflow document must be updated, this update is also recorded using
  a template based on ADR.\n \nBy implementing such a framework, NAS hopes to,\n \nImplement
  preservation plans more consistently without duplication of work,\nImprove governance
  and accountability for decision making,\nEnsure institutional knowledge is retained,
  allowing new staff to learn and understand past decisions.\n \nAn important aspect
  of this pilot is to try and minimise the number of changes required to existing
  practices to not disrupt current operations. Existing documentation will be incorporated,
  while recording of operational decisions will carry on more intentionally and moved
  from email to ADR-based templates.\n \nThis lightning talk describes this pilot
  documentation framework for digital preservation and takeaways from the experience
  so far."
