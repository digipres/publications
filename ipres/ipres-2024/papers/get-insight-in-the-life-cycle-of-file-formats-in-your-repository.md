abstract: 'During this half day workshop you can bring your own data and process it
  with the tool created during the Dutch Digital Heritage Network project for Monitoring
  Obsolete File Formats. We will also provide a dataset for organisation who are not
  able to bring a dataset.


  During iPres 2023 the project was presented. During this workshop the participants
  get hands-on experience and look at the results for their repository.


  We don’t want to waste too much time on presenting the theory upfront. We will first
  have some explanation about the project and what we did, after that we can start!
  You bring your own data as a csv file and install Python on your laptop or in a
  provided environment to get started during the workshop. After your registration
  we send details on what the CSV file needs to contain and what needs to be installed
  or which environment to register for. We prefer to install it upfront, but if you
  don’t succeed, we will help you get started.'
