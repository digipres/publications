abstract: "This Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) specification describes an application-independent
  approach to the storage of digital information in a scalable, structured, transparent,
  and predictable manner. It is designed to promote long-term object management best
  practices within digital repositories. OCFL v1 was released in 2020 with a minor
  update to v1.1 in 2022 containing clarifications and corrections. OCFL is currently
  supported by the Fedora Commons Repository Platform, the InvenioRDM Platform that
  underlies Zenodo, LibNova products and a number of other digital preservation-oriented
  systems.   \n\nThis session will be divided into three sections:\n\nDesign Philosophy
  - The session will begin with a presentation on the history of OCFL and how the
  design process analysed community-provided use cases and requirements to derive
  a set of key objectives for OCFL. The objectives will then be examined in more detail.\n\nImplementing
  OCFL v1 - The presentation will be followed by a more discursive session where we
  will go through the OCFL v1.1 specification and accompanying Implementation Notes,
  and discuss how it is implemented in practice. In particular, we will look at how
  OCFL aims to be self-documenting and the use of the extension mechanism to expand
  OCFL functionality and documentability without compromising the core specification.
  We will also look at the available tests, fixtures and code libraries that are available
  to support implementers, with the opportunity for hands-on exploration.\n\nTowards
  v2 - The process towards a v2 release of the specification is already underway.
  The session will finish with a discussion of the use cases being considered for
  inclusion in v2 as a result of community engagements over the past 18 months and
  progress by the OCFL Editorial team to date, with a view to encouraging more participation
  and contributions."
