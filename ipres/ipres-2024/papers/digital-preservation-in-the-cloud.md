abstract: "In recent years more and more commercial solutions for support of digital
  preservation are moving to the cloud, e.g. Preservica and Rosetta. Others, such
  as Arkivum, have been implemented as hosted applications with attached cloud-storage
  from the start. The number of cloud-customers are growing, which means that customers
  on enterprise solutions must consider cloud solutions to get extra benefits or because
  the support for on-premise solutions will be terminated at some stage. To some organisations,
  this poses a major problem, since they might have institutional regulations, policies
  or other reasons why a cloud solution is not a possibility.\nPreservation involves
  both long-term access and access rights protection, and requirements will vary for
  different types of materials, for instance, open data versus sensitive data such
  as social science research data, that needs extra protection due to its nature and
  legal issues.\nWith cloud-based storage architectures and cloud-based services the
  spectrum of how things are kept safe has become more diverse than ever. Moreover,
  there are differences in whether the bit preservation of metadata and files is in
  the cloud or on-premise. \n \nThis panel will consist of representatives from organisations
  or projects researching and evaluating preservation solutions or using commercial
  solutions either on-premise or in the cloud.\nThe panel will discuss the following
  issues and try to learn from each other’s insights.\n \n\n·         What is the
  take of various heritage organisations on this development towards the cloud?\n
  -     Which barriers do you see in having application and/or storage in the cloud\n·
  \        Which risks do you see when using or not using the cloud, e.g. cyber security
  or shut down of the solution?\n·         Which challenges or opportunities do they
  see in e.g. finances, maintenance, scalability? \n·         How do they envision
  exit strategies for cloud solutions?\n \nThe discussion will focus on the cloud
  questions independent of commercial solutions used by the organisations.\n\nPanelists:\nEld
