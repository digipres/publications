abstract: This paper will present a case study reporting challenges and strategies
  adopted along the development of an information model for digital preservation at
  Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec (BAnQ). Influenced by and for access,
  it will explain how we managed to reconcile our needs with international standards
  and best practices. Concrete examples of information packages will be provided.
