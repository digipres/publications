abstract: "Digital preservation is not a destination, but an on-going journey. As
  such, we need to take steps along that journey, no matter how imperfect, to at least
  attempt to preserve those objects entrusted to us. For too long we had been frozen
  on our journey at Ohio State, when confronted with born digital collections at scale;
  stuck in the binary of how do we describe these collections at the item level to
  ingest them into our existing digital preservation repository, Digital Collections,
  or doing nothing at all. We had simply embraced the latter. \nHowever, in the summer
  of 2021 we began to scheme the development of a lightweight, cloud-based digital
  preservation platform that could complement our existing digital preservation repo.
  One that would be based upon the archival principle of more product, less processing
  (MPLP). As we began to engage stakeholders, as well as architect, build and test
  the repository, we actually realized that this new repo was much more in alignment
  with our collecting and accessioning practices. We were essentially building a digital
  version of archival and special collections stacks. A digital preservation platform
  that contains minimally described objects that are tied to their finding aids, where
  they are discoverable by our users; while being stored in a secure space where only
  the curators can “wander” just like our secured stacks. Therefore, we have created
  a “gray” or “dim” repository, which is neither “light” (allows patron access) nor
  “dark” (essentially no access). Launched in January 2024, the Gray Digital Preservation
  Repository, is now our default repo for born digital content.\nThis poster will
  document the journey we have embarked upon, along with the workflow and tools, open
  source and proprietary, that we have used to build and sustain this new environment.
  While acknowledging the privilege of our institution, we feel there are lessons
  learned from this journey that may benefit institutions of all sizes and resources."
