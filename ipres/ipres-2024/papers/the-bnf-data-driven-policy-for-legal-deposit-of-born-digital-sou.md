abstract: In December 2019, the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF) launched its
  legal deposit program of born-digital sound. The mass of content likely to be received
  by the institution for this purpose is considerable – over 300,000 products per
  year. After a few years of gradual build-up, it has become clear that this mass
  of content will not be manageable without the definition of collections accrual
  policy based on a detailed knowledge of the phonographic publishing landscape and
  the life cycle of these collections. The article will show how methods for analyzing
  data, metadata and identifiers reveal the particular dynamism of phonographic publishing,
  and the need for eligibility controls that take account of the industry's distinct
  objectives. It will also detail the measures taken by BnF as a result of this study.
