abstract: Risk is a frequently used term in digital preservation, though the literature
  and solutions of the field often portray and describe risk in different ways. CHARM
  addresses this with a newly innovative, and comprehensive reference model and corresponding
  vocabulary for the digital preservation risk domain. Inspired by risk science, a
  signature feature of CHARM is its applied distinction between conceptual and characterized
  digital preservation risk. CHARM establishes a conceptual definition of digital
  preservation risk built around a purposeful definition of digital preservation as
  a goal and value-based endeavour, then deconstructs this to develop a cascading
  and logical series of abstract models for the whole digital preservation domain.
  This paper introduces the methodology though which CHARM was developed, presents
  and explains some of the key CHARM models, and discusses some of the methods through
  which CHARM can support scoped yet holistic risk identification and risk assessment
  exercises. This holistic, domain-level solution represents a significant 'scaling
  up' of our disciplinary understanding of digital preservation risk.
