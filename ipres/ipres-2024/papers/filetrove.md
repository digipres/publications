abstract: 'FileTrove is a fast file indexer. It is using siegfried for format identification;
  it checks, if a file is in the NSRL; it creates UUIDs, hash sums, reads file timestamps,
  calculates the entropy and much more. It is planned to add YARA support (what will
  be a hot topic in digital preservation).


  The single binary command line application is written in Golang, uses Sqlite as
  database backend and BoltDB as NSRL SHA1 storage.


  FileTrove is in development at the moment but stable enough to has a BETA release
  in the coming weeks.


  The German Literature Archive Marbach will introduce with the usage of FileTrove
  in its workflows and the author of the tool will present FileTrove, from installation
  to working with the results.
