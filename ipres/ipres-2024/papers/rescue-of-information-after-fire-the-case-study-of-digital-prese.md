abstract: The 2018 fire at the National Museum/UFRJ, a bicentennial institution located
  in Rio de Janeiro/Brazil, considerably affected the entire collection of the institution
  through the action of fire and the collapse of the upper floors of the Palace. Such
  loss includes the more than 11.000 glass plate negatives that documented the academic
  and scientific history of the institution. After the accident, the Memory and Archive
  Section of the museum (SEMEAR) took over the iconographic items of the extinct Photography
  Section, including a series of 219 cardboard with collages of printed photographs.
  After the archivist treatment, the cardboards were digitized, according to Brazilian
  norms for digital preservation. The following analyses revealed that part of these
  photographic cardboards represent printed samples of the lost glass plate negatives,
  constituting the last physical evidence of the lost collection. This highlights
  the importance of the preservation of this material and your scientific dissemination
  to promote the knowledge, the safeguard of the national memory and to offer full
  access to the general public. This collection illustrates scientific expeditions,
  former exhibitions, and didactic materials used by researchers at the National Museum,
  providing a valuable source of knowledge about scientific development in Brazil.
  This study case stands out the importance of document digitalization in the preservation
  of cultural collections preservation. Exemplifies how digitalization not only protects
  the historical and scientific heritage against possible loss, but it allows them
  to be shared and studied for the next generations. In summary, this experience with
  the photographic cardboards of the National Museum/UFRJ shows the crucial role of
  the process of the recuperation and preservation of a valuable cultural and scientific
  heritage, emphasizing the importance of the promotion of information access and
  the encouragement to academic research.
