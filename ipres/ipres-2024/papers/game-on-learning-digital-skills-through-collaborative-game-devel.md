abstract: "This tutorial is aimed at those who are new to digital preservation (although
  all skill levels are welcome), and wish to gain more technical skills, particularly
  in relation to coding. These skills are becoming increasingly important to digital
  preservation, with “Computer Programming” listed as one of the skill elements in
  the Digital Preservation Coalition’s (DPC) Competency Framework. For those new to
  these skills, it can be intimidating and difficult to know where to start. The popularity
  of the Bits and Bots and BitCurator/DPC Python study groups are evidence of this.
  The contributors to this tutorial are drawn from the leadership of both programs,
  and have witnessed first-hand the strong desire for coding skills amongst practitioners.
  This tutorial aims to be a first step in their coding journey for practitioners
  who attend.\n \nParticipants will collaborate in groups to create a game centered
  around the theme of digital preservation. In the process, they will learn basic
  coding skills and will finish with their own interactive text based game on a shareable
  website. Prompts, ideas, templates and sub themes will be provided to help participants
  create their game. This will also have the secondary benefits of allowing participants
  to consider digital preservation from a different perspective, and to gain a better
  understanding of how websites are built and work, knowledge that will help them
  make more informed preservation decisions about web content.\nThe collaborative
  nature of the tutorial on the conference's first day presents an opportunity for
  participants to kick off iPRES 2024 in a fun and social way, connecting with colleagues
  worldwide. Sharing experiences in digital preservation often proves to be the most
  valuable learning experience, and this tutorial is designed to foster such knowledge
  exchange among participants.\n \n**Tutorial outcomes**\nBy the end of the tutorial,
  participants will have: \n-Fundamental coding skills \n-Basic knowledge of HTML
  and CSS \n-Awareness of how tools can be used to develop interactive web content
  \n-A game they can share and/or continue to develop (further building their skills)
  \n-Gained a new perspective/level of understanding of digital preservation\n-Made
  new connections with fellow practitioners"
