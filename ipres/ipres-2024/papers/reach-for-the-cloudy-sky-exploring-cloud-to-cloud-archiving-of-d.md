abstract: "The National Archives (UK) is committed to making transfer of digital records
  faster, easier and more scalable. Our Transfer Digital Records (TDR) service allows
  depositors to upload records from a network drive environment. However, an increasing
  number of users (c86% of UK public record bodies) now use cloud ecosystems, mostly
  SharePoint but also Google drive. Our current digital transfer process requires
  users to extract records from the cloud before transfer (through re-upload to the
  cloud). This is slow, inefficient, error-prone and, most importantly, can disrupt
  or lose metadata (particularly dates). It also introduces challenges in selecting
  export formats. A significant volume of records are affected – both current records
  and legacy data that has been migrated to the cloud. Scalability is essential.\n\nThis
  lighting talk will describe a feasibility study into enabling users to send records
  directly from depositors’ SharePoint services to the Archive, quickly, securely
  and without loss of metadata or file integrity. The study engaged with external
  partners including Microsoft.\n\nCriteria for maintaining integrity were identified:\n•\tTransfer
  user is clearly identified throughout the process\n•\tTransfer consignments are
  identified and tracked\n•\tUsers can select which records to transfer\n•\tThe Archive
  can securely access only selected records\n•\tComprehensive metadata is harvested
  without disruption\n•\tMetadata is in a form suitable for ingest into archival systems\n•\tFiles
  are harvested and uploaded to the Archive for ingest\n•\tHarvesting triggers AWS
  step-functions which automatically initiate archival processing\n•\tUser administration,
  registration and compliance policies are met\n•\tSecurity and accessibility standards
  are met\n\nThe study identified implementation options including full or minimal
  integration with a 3rd party app and bespoke development. The talk will outline
  the options and discuss some outstanding questions which we continue to explore:\n\n•\tResearch
  into usability and adoption rates\n•\tResearch into how depositors organise SharePoint
  metadata\n•\tUnderstanding how the Archive wishes to consume and process harvested
  records and metadata, including custom metadata and tags\n•\tScaling constraints
  on records size or volume\n•\tSustainability of the app approach, including ownership
  models, costs, maintenance, support, exit strategy"
