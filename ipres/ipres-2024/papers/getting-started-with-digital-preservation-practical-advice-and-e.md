abstract: This poster highlights my efforts to introduce and advocate for digital
  preservation at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE). Southern Illinois
  University Edwardsville is a mid-sized public University in the initial stages of
  developing a sustainable, scalable digital archives program that is built with long
  term preservation in mind. The presentation will focus on lessons learned, providing
  realistic advice to other individuals working with limited resources who are in
  the beginning stages of advocating for digital preservation at their institution.
  I will reflect on the challenges of building a sustainable program from scratch
  while in a short-term position, and offer practical solutions for long term preservation
  that do not rely on specialized technical knowledge. The poster will give examples
  of what worked for our library and what didn’t work, and will address how to determine
  priorities and what can be “let go” when ideal digital preservation is not an immediately
  attainable goal. Finally, I will report on my experience migrating from SIUE’s unregulated
  and unmonitored internal “dark archive” server to our newly purchased Preservica
  site.
