abstract: 'The study and practice of digital preservation has changed dramatically
  since the first iPRES conference in 2004. A relatively young field with practitioners
  and researchers setting research agendas and finding their way, digital preservation
  increasingly has been considered an essential aspect of work in the information
  professions – with substantial input from the fields of libraries, archives, and
  museums. This poster is intended for both new and seasoned researchers and practitioners
  interested in reflecting on the changes in the field, focusing on 2012 to the present
  day; it can serve as a benchmark as the field looks to the future. Participants
  will explore perspectives on changes in digital preservation over the past 10+ years
  and their implications for current and future practice.


  In 2014, the first edition of Digital Preservation for Libraries, Archives, and
  Museums was published, following two years of research and writing. A second edition
  was researched in 2015-16. As writing is completed in 2023-24 on the third edition,
  this poster reflects on eight major changes in thinking about digital preservation
  that we have observed: 1) Technology/Systems; 2) Standards and “best practices”;
  3) Environmental sustainability; 4) Funding and financial; 5) Supporting marginalized
  communities: 6) Community, collaboration, and consortial models; 7) Research; 8)
  Training and education. This poster will focus on these eight topics; as described
  below. We will be using graphical means when possible to present these ideas and
  to explore potential implications.'
