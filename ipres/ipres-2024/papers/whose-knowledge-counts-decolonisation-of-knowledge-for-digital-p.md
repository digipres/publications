abstract: 'The decolonization of knowledge, particularly concerning the preservation
  and sustainability of Indigenous knowledge in Africa, necessitates a comprehensive
  re-evaluation of how such knowledge is produced, digitized, communicated, and preserved.
  This lightning talk, "Whose Knowledge Counts?: Decolonisation of Knowledge for Digital
  Preservation and Sustainability of Indigenous Knowledge in Africa," addresses the
  critical need for inclusive digital preservation policies and practices that authentically
  represent Indigenous voices and perspectives.


  The current findings in South Africa, reveal significant gaps in digital preservation
  policies for Indigenous knowledge systems (IKS) in Africa. Indigenous knowledge
  owners lack effective mechanisms and policies for long-term digital preservation.
  Although some African countries have initiated policies to manage Indigenous knowledge,
  there is often a lack of meaningful engagement with Indigenous communities, resulting
  in insufficient representation and benefits for these communities.


  In Kenya, we have mapped Indigenous knowledge holders, community archives, libraries
  and museums in Elgeyo Marakwet County. The county leadership has embraced stakeholder
  involvement in digital preservation and conservation efforts, setting a precedent
  for community-driven initiatives in Indigenous knowledge preservation. Despite these
  efforts, the lack of standardized metadata for Indigenous knowledge systems hinders
  the accessibility and integration of local knowledge into digital preservation frameworks
  for more than 90 community libraries, museums, traditional medical centers, botanic
  gardens, cultural sites within the Keiyo and Marakwet communities of Kenya.


  We have used application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies,
  such as ChatGPT, Bing AI, and Gemini AI, which presents a promising opportunity
  for decolonizing knowledge and addressing metadata challenges in the global ecosystem.
  The AI tools can facilitate the identification, creation, discovery, access, organization,
  dissemination, and preservation of Indigenous knowledge. However, there is a critical
  need for sustained investment in local and Indigenous knowledge systems, digital
  inclusion and skill development to ensure that Indigenous knowledge is accurately
  and respectfully preserved and integrated into the global information and knowledge
  ecosystem. This talk showcases the ongoing partnerships between local and global
  stakeholders to develop inclusive and sustainable digital preservation strategies
  for Indigenous knowledge in Africa.'
