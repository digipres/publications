abstract: "__DROID__ is an open-source tool used by thousands of archives to support
  their Digital Preservation workflows. It allows large volumes of files to be characterised
  to determine the precise format of each digital file, and to capture important technical
  parameters including creating checksums using a variety of algorithms to help enable
  trust in the end-to-end integrity of digital records.  \n\nThe National Archives
  (UK) have been working on some significant improvements to DROID in the last year.
  \ These have focused on addressing some of the main problems that users (particularly
  those who are new to using DROID) encounter with the application.  Most importantly
  though, has been the addition of a new feature to allow DROID to generate customisable,
  templated metadata manifests which can be used as an early step in cataloguing digital
  files or preparing them for processing.  It arose from real-world challenges facing
  archivists and records managers handling large collections, and allows the removal
  of complex manual steps in some current workflows.  The feature has been designed
  to be applicable to a wide range of users and customisable to the needs of different
  institutions. \n\nAlthough the feature will be documented in the DROID 6.8.0 instructions,
  this Lightning Talk will give an overview and visual walkthrough of the new capability,
  to spread awareness and allow more people to benefit from this feature, and to begin
  conversations about how to develop this further in future releases."
