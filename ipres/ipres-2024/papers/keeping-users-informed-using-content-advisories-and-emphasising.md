abstract: 'There is an increasing importance to ensure that archive users have informed
  consent regarding what they are viewing. When this is applied to a digital archive,
  it can be more difficult to ensure that users know what they are accessing prior
  to viewing it due to the number of ways that digital data can be accessed. Add in
  the further complication of human remains from a British early medieval cemetery
  and things get a bit more complicated. The Archaeology Data Service, as a part of
  the High Speed 2 (HS2) infrastructure project, was tasked with archiving and disseminating
  data pertaining to the human remains from several cemeteries that were excavated
  over the course of the project. This talk will discuss the steps that the ADS took
  to add content advisories and context to digital archives that contained digital
  objects relating to different individuals.


  So how was this done? Each digital archive and digital object that contains data
  about human remains receives a tag stating what sensitive information it contains.
  This tag then triggers notifications on the archive metadata page, the object metadata
  page, and blurs images/3D models where applicable. While this approach works to
  provide practical information for users, we felt that some digital objects should
  also be disseminated with additional contextual information. Within the medieval
  cemeteries excavated as part of HS2, most individuals were not easily identifiable,
  but we could give as much context as possible to each individual by linking each
  individual’s photogrammetry model with associated contextual information and excavation
  photos. This information was provided on an individual level with a specific web
  page that displayed an interactive 3D model and the associated contextual information.
  For larger cemeteries, the individuals were also presented spatially by showing
  their burial locations on a web map with a sidebar that provides the additional
  contextual information and links to the individual’s information page. The tagging
  and techniques that were used can be applied more broadly and include instances
  where harmful language is used for example and we hope to apply what we learned
  from HS2 to the rest of our archival holdings.'
