abstract: "Our digital heritage users want to be able to find and use all sources
  available. Of course, it all starts with preserving our digital heritage in the
  long term for our designated communities to find. We as a community have to help
  them find the information taking into account their knowledge base, needs and wishes.\nBut
  on the downside, this storage and use of digital data costs: it produces carbon
  dioxide (CO2) emissions. It has an impact on our environment. \nA few years ago,
  the Dutch Digital Heritage Network started a climate awareness campaign. \nIn talking
  to heritage organizations we realized a few things:\n\n - List item\n\nClimate awareness
  grows and from within: a few colleagues that are ‘green minded’ meet up and campaign
  their cause within the organization. \n\n - List item\n\nSome heritage organizations
  are already taking positive climate measures: they are reusing exhibition materials,
  stimulating visitors to take public transport or bike to the museum, greening their
  buildings and depots. \n\n - List item\n\nThe large impact of IT is not always noticed
  or taken into account. And if it is, you are faced with dilemma’s like servicing
  your online users in a different or slower manner or be more selective in preserving
  data or documents(no endless copies). \n\n - List item\n\nThere is a need for more
  solid, trustworthy information: what are the numbers or figures around climate impact.
  \n\nSo how do we get on with the campaign? We hope to keep the conversation going
  within the network. We publish guides about organizing and establishing a greener
  IT environment in your organization, e.g. making your websites more sustainable.
  We have a green techwatcher on board blogging about storage, green software, user
  dilemma’s and AI. We share tips and challenges and organize a few events about greener
  IT. \nThis lightning talk will show some of our results within the Dutch Digital
  Heritage Network but will hopefully and more importantly keep the conversation going
  about climate impact and how to tackle this within the preservation community. And
  maybe it inspires you to start you own climate action campaign."
