abstract: 'How has technology transformed higher education? How has higher education
  transformed technology? The learning experience for University students today bears
  very little resemblance to the experience of a student who matriculated in, say,
  1970. The methods for delivering teaching, submitting assessments, and interacting
  with peers have completely transformed institutions of higher learning as well as
  the type of skills and capabilities of their graduates. These changes have contributed
  to a widespread transformation of the UK’s economy – indeed the global economy –
  which touch almost every aspect of life.

  This paper describes a student internship at the University of Edinburgh aimed at
  preserving legacy issues of the University’s Computing Services’ newsletter BITs
  (Bulletin of IT Services). The newsletter provides unique detail about how the implementation
  of new technologies – like the ‘Good old Internet’ – have supported and even driven
  seismic change to University education. These digital archives provide rich insights
  into how new technologies were perceived by staff, priorities for resourcing new
  platforms, and the day-to-day changes to working and studying brought on by new
  tools and services. However, until summer 2023, many of those archives were trapped
  on decaying CDs and DVDs stored by the Graphic Design team.

  Through a close collaboration between Graphic Design and Digital Archives, a student
  internship was developed to help recover these historic glimpses of technological
  innovation at the University in the late 90s and early 00s. Without resourcing for
  a dedicated space for forensics processing, the team assembled an ‘on-the-fly’ forensics
  station. Though far from ideal, the on-the-fly workstation allowed the student intern
  to sit with the Graphic Design team to ask questions about past projects and ways
  of working. Facing numerous challenges (such as training a first-year undergraduate
  on digital preservation, forensics software, and how to open a jewel case), this
  project helped to demonstrate that without dedicated funding, many important resources
  from across the University will be lost. However, the project also enjoyed a few
  highly rewarding victories, including recovery of (almost) all the legacy editions
  of BITs and watching a Gen Z undergraduate explain Y2K to peer student interns.'
