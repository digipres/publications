abstract: This presentation delves into the rearchitecting of a preservation archive
  service to demonstrate the transformative potential of the cloud to bolster the
  capabilities of preservation systems for long term sustainability, resiliency, and
  scalability. Despite inherent technological complexities, obscure jargon, and potential
  pitfalls, such as unexpected costs and security risks, this presentation advocates
  for a simplified approach as the key to unlocking the full benefits of cloud platforms
  for preservation activities. Explore distinct steps and discrete actions across
  the entire ecosystem that improve security posture, reduce operational and development
  efforts, and lower the costs of computing resources based on industry concepts.
  By implementing these streamlined approaches, preservation organizations can effectively
  harness the power of the cloud to achieve far greater capacity with a minimalist
  strategy. Using the real-world experiences of a small tech team, this presentation
  aims to equip preservationists, preservation technologists, and leadership with
  the insights and strategies to successfully implement scalable, efficient and secure
  cloud solutions, for a sustainable preservation future.
