abstract: "As born digital and digitized collections continue to grow and researchers
  increasingly request to use collections as data, cultural heritage institutions
  must enable computational use of their collections. As is often the case in libraries,
  competing priorities may result in limited resources for strictly managing digital
  collections. Beyond making digital collections accessible, abstracting born digital
  and digitized collections into datasets for digital scholarship could pose a myriad
  of technical, legal, resource, and workflow challenges.   \n\nThe Library of Congress
  recognizes the critical need for determining and implementing a coordinated approach
  to support use of collections for digital scholarship, as outlined in the [Digital
  Collections Strategy][1]. Prior to and as a result of the strategy, options for
  advancing this work were explored through a variety of experiments, pilots, research
  reports, and working group discussions. \n\nThis year, the Library of Congress reached
  a major milestone in hiring its first Digital Collections Data Librarian to routinize
  the service of creating collections as data for researcher access.   \n\nThe Digital
  Collections Data Librarian works within the Library ’s Digital Collections Management
  and Services Division to centralize work and support computational use of the Library’s
  born digital and digitized collections and implement a coordinated approach to support
  use of collections as data for digital scholarship. \n\nThe Data Librarian is formalizing
  and enhancing previously piloted efforts to transform data from digital collections,
  including born digital content, digitized books, and web archives, into datasets
  ready for computational use. They are providing analysis and advice, and developing
  solutions to solve issues and problems associated with digital lifecycle management
  of collections and derived datasets.  \n\nFor the lightning talk, we will give an
  overview on how the position originated, onboarding and orientation efforts, projects
  underway and outcomes/accomplishments achieved within the first few months. We will
  also outline upcoming plans and ways that attendees can get updates on this new
  program area.  \n\n\n\n  [1]: https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2021/12/library-of-congress-digital-collections-strategy-published/"
