abstract: The Digital Preservation Storage Criteria Committee has worked on creating
  and refining the DP Storage Criteria for almost a decade. As members have rotated
  off and the remaining members face increasing time constraints, we recognize that
  we need to broaden our approach to stewardship of the Criteria and work with new
  partners who can help with ongoing revisions and maintenance. But who will best
  help steer the boat?  Come discuss the possibilities with us and help influence
  the DP Storage Criteria's future!
