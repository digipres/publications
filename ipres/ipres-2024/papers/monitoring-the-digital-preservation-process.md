abstract: "The National Library of Norway needed a simple way to visualize how the
  digital collection continuously grows. Additionally, there was a need to monitor
  the flow of data at all times. \n\nWe chose to use Grafana as the monitoring tool
  for this purpose. Grafana is open source and is a web application that can run on
  multiple platforms. It provides business insights and interactive visualization
  of statistics. It allows displaying charts, graphs, and alerts on a website connected
  to supported data sources. \n\nWe chose to use Grafana for the following purposes:
  \n\nStatistics showing the inventory for preservation. Here, we can display the
  growth in the number of archival packages, number of files, and data volume. This
  can then be differentiated by media type (text, moving images, audio, images, and
  web archives). Within each media type, we can further differentiate by subtypes.
  This has proven to be very useful and is a simple way to demonstrate what is preserved
  digitally in the National Library. \n\nMonitoring of throughput. Here, we create
  graphs that show the flow of data from submission to finished preserved archival
  package for multiple production lines. This enables us to see bottlenecks and queues
  that may arise in the ongoing production. This allows us to quickly assess the \"health\"
  of the system and take action before the problem becomes too large."
