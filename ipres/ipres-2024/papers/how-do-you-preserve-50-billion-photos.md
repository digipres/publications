abstract: 'Flickr has more than 50 billion photos, a vast and growing collection beginning
  at the first days of photography and continuing to just moments ago. But as we’ve
  seen, social media platforms can go dark or disappear at short notice, and take
  with them unique and enormous slices of our cultural heritage. Can we do better?


  How *do* you preserve something like Flickr? It’s simply too big for any one cultural
  heritage institution to preserve, so what else can we do?


  And *what* do you select to preserve from Flickr? What makes up an archival version
  of a Flickr photo? How do we do better than a bucket of JPEGs? Which metadata is
  valuable? How do we represent the networked nature of objects in a service like
  Flickr?


  At [the Flickr Foundation](https://www.flickr.org/), our mission is to keep Flickr
  photos visible for 100 years. What does long-term stewardship of social objects
  mean? What do we need to put in place to govern across generations?


  We’re considering these questions as we develop our Data Lifeboat concept, which
  is part of [our Content Mobility program](https://www.flickr.org/programs/content-mobility/).
  We’d love to share this work with you, and hear what you think. Come along to this
  session to hear about what we’ve been working on, what we’ve already made, and other
  questions we’re stumped by.'
