abstract: 'The digital city (DDS) started in 1994 as the first community platform
  targeted to the general public in The Netherlands. DDS had as its mission to enable
  the general public to explore the possibilities of the then-new internet. As stated
  by the founders the interface was supposed to be user-friendly to such an extent
  that even people with no computer experience would be able to use it. But looking
  at the history of DDS, some of these initial values hardly came to fruition because
  others like innovation were prioritized. The ideological commitments of the founders
  arguably predetermined which values would win out in practice. In this article I
  will illustrate how DDS can be analysed as charismatic technology to explain how
  underlying values influenced the design and how this impacted the community. Understanding
  how conflicting values, ambiguity and doubt were handled by the management of this
  early online community is an important lesson for preservation. On a practical level
  we need to know how to inform our designated community about these conflicting values
  as available in the representation information on this important UNESCO-heritage
  collection. What do we want our users to understand about it? At a deeper level
  we can see parallels between the community of DDS and our own community: the designated
  community. Lessons learned through analyzing the historical struggles of trying
  to make the DDS-community more diverse might still be relevant if we aim to understand
  more about how to apply the concept of the designated community within our own institutions.'
