abstract: "The documentation of workflows within only one institution is already challenging
  and time-consuming. But how can workflows within a consortium with several institutions
  be represented and handled? The poster describes how existing workflows from different
  institutions can be combined and linked. \nIn the LaVaH consortium twelve Hessian
  universities and unversities of applied sciences work together with the headquarters
  of the hebis library network for a common digital preservation network of digital
  data in Hesse. Based on a distributed infrastructure, the local data curators are
  responsible for curating and selecting objects for preservation and creating the
  submission information packages (SIP). The archiving process is carried out centrally
  by the hebis headquarters.\nThe institutions have different types of data that need
  to be archived. There are also different collections within an institution, which
  come from different sources and go through their own workflows in the run-up to
  long-term archiving. Different ingest formats are defined for the respective collections,
  i.e. the form in which the submission information packages (SIP) are packed and
  the format in which the metadata is delivered. Accordingly, the processes and tools
  that accompany the path from existing data and metadata to a SIP are different.
  Various tools are used at the institutions, e.g. for digitizing historical sources.
  It therefore makes sense to exchange about the partners' approach and to check if
  existing routines and tools can be reused by other institutions. \nTo achieve a
  structured overview of the various processes and workflows all partners are asked
  to describe the workflows in their companies, as well as to identify who is responsible
  and name the tools used. The results are presented in an internal workshop.\nThe
  poster describes the different workflows with possible overlaps and interfaces on
  the one hand and the process towards a common understanding and representation on
  the other."
