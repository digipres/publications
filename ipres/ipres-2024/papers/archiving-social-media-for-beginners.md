abstract: "Social media has become an integral part of our daily lives. Moreover,
  social media play a very important role in communicating about various social topics
  and do so by a wide range of actors. As such, the channels serve as a valuable source
  for (scientific) research, but, because of the volatile nature of the content, they
  are still rarely archived. We collaborated with KADOC-KU Leuven in the project Best
  Practices for the Archiving of Social Media in Flanders and Brussels, to research
  how to capture and archive this specific online information and make it future-proof.
  During the project, we tested a large number of tools, developed workflows and wrote
  manuals for archiving social media, and published them on our knowledge base. The
  manuals are written to facilitate users with little to no IT skills to start archiving
  social media. \n\nAn overview of the published manuals and workflows on our knowledge
  base:\n- [Archiving YouTube videos using Tartube](https://www.projectcest.be/wiki/Publicatie:YouTube_video%27s_archiveren_met_Tartube)
  \n- [Archiving social media accounts using ArchiveWeb.page](https://www.projectcest.be/wiki/Publicatie:Sociale_media_accounts_archiveren_met_ArchiveWeb.page)\n-
  [Workflows for capturing social media accounts](https://www.projectcest.be/wiki/Publicatie:Workflows_voor_de_captatie_van_individuele_sociale_media_accounts)\n\nThese
  will be translated into English before iPRES 2024.\n\nWhat will you learn?\n-----\n\nThis
  hands-on workshop aims to give the participants an easy way to start archiving social
  media accounts. The tools introduced during the workshop are selected to be user-friendly
  and will be jointly configured and used to capture social media content during the
  workshop. \n\nWe would like to introduce the following tools:\n- ArchiveWeb.page,
  a Chrome extension for capturing social media accounts while retaining the look
  & feel;\n- Tartube, a tool for archiving videos, channels and accounts of video-sharing
  platforms, e.g. YouTube;\n- Browsertrix-cloud (TBD), a hosted solution for capturing
  social media accounts while retaining the look & feel;\n- ReplayWeb.page, a hosted
  solution for accessing web archives.\n\nThe final list is subject to change. All
  tools are open-source and free. \n\nAt the end of the workshop participants will
  have a captured social media account and will be able to use the introduced tools
  independently."
