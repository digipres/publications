abstract: "From the very start of digital preservation, KB National Library of the
  Netherlands (KBNL) has played a pioneering role in the digital preservation community.
  From the NEDLIB project in the 90s of the twentieth century, the worldwide first
  operational e-Depot in accordance with the OAIS standard in 2002, to important contributions
  to international research in digital preservation in the first years of the twenty-first
  century. KBNL shared its successes and knowledge with the digital preservation community
  by means of papers, professional visits and conferences. \nBut at a certain point
  in time KBNL became a bit quiet, and remained quiet for a while. Until almost ten
  years later, when the organization brought renewed focus on its preservation activities.
  again on the world stage of the digital preservation community with the purchase
  of Rosetta and the achievement of CTS. \nBut what happened in those quiet years,
  and more importantly, how did it happen, and most importantly, how do we prevent
  it from happening again?\nIn this paper, I share my personal reflections on the
  impact of organizational context on thirty years of digital preservation within
  KBNL, to unlock the past, present and future of digital preservation within our
  institution. In my opinion, it is of interest to know what the “embodied experience”
  is like from a practical point of view, and the personal perspective is important
  because preservation is more than just policy. Although sharing honest stories in
  public is, unfortunately, not usually an option, we think it’s important to be open
  to the community about our challenges, and things that have not gone as well as
  we liked, so we can all learn from those experiences and move forward together.\n\n“Many
  times what we perceive as an error or failure is actually a gift. And eventually
  we find that lessons learned from that discouraging experience prove to be of great
  worth.”"
