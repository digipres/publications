abstract: 'The issue of file formats conversion is crucial in the field of digital
  repositories. In fact, electronic records are encoded in the most diverse file formats
  (text, still images, audio and video recordings, technical records and many other
  digital media formats), but they are bound to become rapidly obsolete (and in some
  cases already are) and need to be converted from one file format to another in order
  to preserve the authenticity, reliability, integrity and usability of such records
  as evidence of business functions, processes, activities and transactions.


  Consequently, the challenge of identifying when file formats need to be converted,
  which formats to choose for conversion, and which approaches to apply from an operational
  point of view begins to emerge.


  However, despite being theorized as one of the most successful digital preservation
  solutions, format conversion has not yet been sufficiently practiced. Even when
  the need to transfer electronic records from an obsolete format to a more modern
  one is adequately felt, the process is often delayed due to a lack of knowledge
  and expertise, as well as a lack of clear and precise guidelines and advice on how
  to carry out the conversion, including technical and operational methods.


  This paper aims to address this issue by referring both to the international standards
  and guidelines and on the Italian “Guidelines on the creation, management and preservation
  of electronic documents”, issued by the Italian Agency for Digital Government (in
  particular with reference to”) and in particular will focus on the operational methodology
  for file format conversion contained in Annex 2 “File formats and conversion”'
