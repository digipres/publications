abstract: At NC State University Libraries, the Special Collections Research Center
  leverages an integrated system of locally developed applications and open-source
  technologies to facilitate the long-term preservation of digitized and born-digital
  archival assets. These applications automate many previously manual tasks, such
  as creating access derivatives from preservation scans and ingest into preservation
  storage. They have allowed us to scale up the number of digitized assets we create
  and publish online; born-digital assets we acquire from storage media, appraise,
  and package; and total assets in local and distributed preservation storage. The
  origin of these applications lies in scripted workflows put into use more than a
  decade ago, and the applications were built in close collaboration with developers
  in the Digital Library Initiatives department between 2011 and 2023. This paper
  presents a strategy for managing digital curation and preservation workflows that
  does not solely depend on standalone and third-party applications. It describes
  our iterative approach to deploying these tools, the functionalities of each application,
  and sustainability considerations of managing in-house applications and using Academic
  Preservation Trust for offsite preservation.
