abstract: 'Since research data are considered to be of great value for prospective
  research in terms of re-usability, research institutions and libraries need appraisal
  strategy with regard to research data. „The Long-Term Preservation of Research Data
  Challenge“ is intended to illustrate the dilemmas and the consequences of decisions
  made by practitioners in this field. It is built upon a catalogue of selection criteria
  developed by German digital preservation (long-time-archiving) project LaVaH in
  Hesse and its working group ''appraisal'' in which several research organisations
  and archives participate. During the game, a data curator follows a working routine
  in a library and has a limited amount of time and storage available for research
  data whithin the long-term archive. They must set priorities according to the profile
  and the mission of the home institution, interpret the guidelines and invest time
  and effort in the advocacy of long-term archiving in order to clarify the requirements
  and challenges to the stakeholders within the institution. Will the data curator
  be able to fulfill the task and how will the decisions taken with regard to certain
  limitations impact the outcome?

  The game is built in Twine as an html-file and can be played in a browser with no
  further limitations imposed on infrastructure.'
