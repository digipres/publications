abstract: The DRS Futures project is a multi-year effort to re-envision and revitalize
  Harvard Library’s preservation environment with expanded functionality, reliability,
  and sustainability.  The project has followed a three-phased approach of initial
  open-ended envisioning of an ideal repository, subsequent specification of an achievable
  repository, and final deployment of an operational repository. This work aims to
  replace the Digital Repository Service (DRS) that Harvard Library has maintained
  for 25 years as a highly customized homegrown preservation system. Although subject
  to continual enhancement over time, the DRS has now reached the effective limits
  of its conceptual design and operational capacity and needs to go through a generational
  modernization. The Library set a high benchmark for project success in terms of
  ten aspirational goals for support of “any” content, conditions, users, and uses.  In
  a departure from traditional enterprise procurement practice, the project also adopted
  a framework of ten “radical” transformative work principles. This framework and
  the insights gained from Harvard's initiative provide useful examples for other
  institutions considering similar programmatic change.
