abstract: "We’ve all been there once. A newbie. A beginner. Thrown in at the deep
  end and left to get on with it. How hard can it be? You’ve just got to look after
  the digital ”stuff”… \n\nand keep it usable… \n\nand not lose it… \n\nand describe
  it… \n\nand make sure what you’re doing is legal… \n\nand… \n\nand… \n\nand…\n\nHmmm.
  Perhaps not so easy.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n![Some time later][1]\n\n There's been
  an Oops. Big or small. It doesn’t matter. What does matter is that, with the benefit
  of hindsight, it could have been avoided. And to make it worse, someone just shared
  the immortal line “I could have told you that would happen.”\n\nThis panel session
  is intended to surface as many of those “Oops! If only…” scenarios as possible,
  and then let the panel/audience decide which of these are the most important to
  be aware of for those **Starting 2 Preserve** .\n\nWe see this as an interactive
  panel session utilising the expertise of up to 7 authorities from the field of Digital
  Preservation and related disciplines. Each will be asked to briefly put forward
  an anecdote / point of view / opinion relating to most important nugget of Digital
  Preservation wisdom they wish they’d known before they started. The statements will
  be followed by a series of questions designed to explore those scenarios further.
  \n\nThe audience will be invited to participate (and contribute their own “if only...”
  scenarios) through a series of questions/observations from the floor (both those
  in attendance and those attending virtually). In particular, the audience will be
  polled at the end of the session to see what they think is(are) the most important
  thing(s) the past can warn future Digital Preservation practitioners about.\n\nThis
  is the third in a series of panel discussions that have taken place it iPres over
  the past two years. Although presented in a light hearted fashion, we see this as
  a particularly useful way of surfacing the common pitfalls experienced by those
  taking their first steps into Digital Preservation that could have been avoided…
  if only someone had told them.\n\n\n  [1]: https://78.media.tumblr.com/13765181be5a9e444a7b4e4bc8ed19b4/tumblr_pc4rqoskHi1u6nopoo2_1280.jpg"
