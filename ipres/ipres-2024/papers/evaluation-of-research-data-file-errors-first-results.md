abstract: 'The digital preservation community is well acquainted with text publications,
  as well as file format identification and validation of these file types. In contrast,
  research data publications are becoming more frequent, introducing more or different
  kinds of format errors messages.

  The PUBLISSO – Repository for Life Sciences at ZB MED – Information Centre for Life
  Sciences contains both types of publication. In the process of transferring these
  to the digital preservation system, differences in file error messages and error
  handling emerged. This lightning talk intends to give a first view into the error
  types prominent for research data, comparing them to typical errors for text publications.
  It will focus specifically on those types of format validation and identification
  error messages that often indicate severe file errors. It will also introduce a
  possible approach to researching these error messages and their causes, as well
  as an example of resolving errors post-publication. Furthermore, it will raise various
  questions – such as ways to approach preservation actions that result in slight
  file changes and if these actions may already have an effect on research data integrity
  and technical compatibility with research software. It will also touch upon the
  question of handling relevant context material like standards which are not published
  alongside research data but may be necessary for its reusability in the long-term.
  Finally, it will give an overview of changes to our repository publication policy
  that have been introduced as a consequence of discussing these topics.'
