abstract: "In 2022, the National Library Singapore released the metadata of our digital
  collection in the form of **[open datasets][1]** comprising various formats like
  digitised books, maps, newspapers, images, audio-video recordings and websites for
  non-commercial analysis to facilitate new channels of discovery and benefits:\n\n1.\t**Accelerating
  organisational change through creativity and innovation** to improve existing research
  services.\n2.\t**Adapting to remain relevant with rapid technological changes and
  adopting modern tools** for content delivery and user engagement.\n3.\t**Leveraging
  artificial intelligence to enhance access of collections** by transcribing, translating,
  and transliterating digitised materials and datasets.\n4.\t**Offering machine-readable
  formats to use in interactive ways** like digital storytelling.\n5.\t**Contributing
  to digital scholarship** to uncover new insights.\n6.\t**Expanding collaborative
  opportunities** with heritage and new cross-sector players to enhance research.\n\nResearch
  opportunities for preserved data are promising and possibilities abound. Our digital
  collection has inspired collaborations with academic institutions. We participated
  in projects such as:\n\n1.\t**[Singapore Biographical Database][2]**, an initiative
  between the Department of Chinese Studies National University of Singapore, National
  Library Singapore, and Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations featuring
  the networks of prominent Chinese personalities who made significant contributions
  to Singapore. \n2.\t**[Southeast Asia Historical Maps][3]** led by Yale-NUS College
  to develop a database of digitised historic maps of Singapore and Southeast Asia
  to facilitate knowledge on maritime activity and trade.\n3.\t**[Singapore Ecological
  History Maps][4]** led by Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore
  using GIS map layers of Singapore to illustrate land use and change, epidemics,
  and urban expansion.\n\nAs part of our service vision, there are further plans to:\n\n1.\tProvide
  thematic metadata open datasets.\n2.\tOffer open datasets for copyright free content
  from our digital collection.\n3.\tProvide other types of datasets like API.\n4.\tWork
  with partners to produce new datasets. \n\nFrom document to data(sets), the National
  Library Singapore has demonstrated forward thinking in our collections strategy
  to shift from physical to digital, and from digital to data(sets), leading to new
  opportunities for access, research, innovation, and preservation for our present
  and future generations.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/discover-and-learn/discover-our-collections/National-Library-Datasets\n
