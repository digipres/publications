abstract: 'The PREMIS (Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies) Data Dictionary
  defines a set of metadata that most repositories of digital objects would need to
  record and use in order to preserve those objects over the long term. The international
  PREMIS Editorial Committee (EC) coordinates maintenance and revisions, and provides
  guidance on the implementation. It is implemented in digital preservation projects
  around the world, and support for PREMIS is incorporated into several commercial
  and open-source digital preservation tools and systems. PREMIS has recently released
  a public draft of a major revision of its RIGHTS entity, and the Editorial Committee
  is continuing its practice of gathering feedback from the community and encouraging
  open conversations about digital preservation Rights use cases that these changes
  are meant to address. Please join several members of the Editorial Committee for
  a Birds-of-a-Feather for current PREMIS users and those who are interested in implementing
  PREMIS at their institution in the future. The conversation will include a brief
  introduction to preservation metadata and the key concepts and the data model for
  PREMIS. The conversation will move on to the proposed changes to the Rights entity,
  to gather more feedback for finalizing the update. The PREMIS EC also wants to hear
  about the communityâ€™s needs as users, and how we can provide support through the
  content on our webpage, other available resources like Zenodo, and the possibility
  of engaging with us in more tutorials and Implementation Fairs.'
