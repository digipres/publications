abstract: 'Abstract: [Purpose/Significance] Since 2013, the National Digital Preservation
  Center (hereinafter referred to as the NDPC) led by the National Science and Technology
  Library has constructed 71 agreements for the long-term preservation of digital
  science and technology resources. However, there are problems, such as delayed submission
  and incomplete data from publishers, that negatively impact the long-term preservation
  of digital science and technology resources. Therefore, it is necessary to perform
  a performance quality evaluation to serve as an effective means of restraint. [Method/Process]
  The key indicators in the long-term preservation agreement were extracted based
  on the implementation work. The evaluation indicators were enhanced through expert
  investigation to establish a performance quality evaluation system for publishers.
  Subsequently, the NDPC institution conducted scoring and division of levels to identify
  common issues and propose incentive and constraint mechanisms. [Results/Conclusion]
  The long-term preservation of digital science and technology resources lack robust
  business-oriented constraints. It is recommended to establish incentive and constraint
  mechanisms from combining long-term preservation to contract renewal, publicity
  of ranking, and data crawling authorization to urge publishers to enhance performance
  quality.'
