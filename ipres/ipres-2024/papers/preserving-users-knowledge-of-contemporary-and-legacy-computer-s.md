abstract: 'Preserving and ensuring access to operational knowledge is essential for
  future users of emulation technologies. Emulation allows for the collection of a
  vast array of computer systems and software products, each requiring specific operational
  knowledge for effective use. Beyond manuals and documentation, an important source
  of targeted operational knowledge comes from observing experienced users in action
  as they interact with these systems. In this article, we propose an automated approach
  to document user interactions during an emulation session. We then apply computer
  vision (OCR) and modern large language models (LLMs) to automatically analyze and
  distill knowledge from the captured data. This process allows the extracted (text-based)
  information to be easily retrievable via standard search utilities; furthermore,
  the information is prepared to become actionable for both humans and machines.


  Keywords: Documentation, Emulation, Usability, Knowledge Management.'
