abstract: "Successful preservation of any content is contingent on obtaining the material
  in the first place, and - ideally - doing so in a way that fits your organization’s
  long-term usability goals. Email collections of historic value present specific
  acquisition challenges to collecting institutions, raising a host of technical,
  legal, and ethical questions. While the tools and workflows for collecting email
  have steadily matured in recent years, there is still little guidance on how to
  acquire email collections in the first place. \n\nAn independent group of archivists
  and records managers representing leading university libraries, international centers
  for email research, corporate archives, and cultural heritage organizations (with
  members located across the US, Canada, and the UK) formed in 2021 to discuss these
  issues and have been compiling good practice recommendations into a guide for the
  benefit of other practitioners. This guide will be released as a draft in 2024 for
  community feedback.\n\nThis workshop will offer participants the opportunity to
  connect with peers and critically evaluate the draft release of the email acquisition
  good practice guide. Attendees should review the draft prior to attending the workshop
  and arrive prepared to discuss how the report corresponds with their experience
  of working with email collections and its prospective usefulness for future accessioning
  of email. \n\nThe workshop will begin with a brief overview of the guide, its background,
  and a high-level summary of its recommendations. Attendees will then circulate to
  stations based on specific sections of the guide and brainstorm what works well
  and what could be improved. Remote attendees will hold discussions in a parallel
  set of Zoom breakout rooms correlating to each section of the guide. At the end
  of the small group discussions, there will be a large group recap with breakout
  groups reporting their takeaways in a shared Google Document. Following the conference,
  we will share the revised report with the workshop participants and encourage their
  continued involvement with refining, completing and disseminating the resulting
  “good practices” document."
