abstract: "The Energy Data Centre (EDC) is part of the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC).
  UKERC carries out inter-disciplinary research into sustainable energy futures. The
  EDC curates UK energy research data, provides a discovery portal and expert advice
  on data management planning to UKERC researchers.  \nIn 2020, the authors joined
  the EDC and made explicit the implicit policy in place. They created formal collection
  management, collection cataloguing and preservation policies.  As part of the process,
  they undertook a Digital Preservation Coalition’s Rapid Assessment Model (RAM) review
  and created a development plan.  These activities were focused on the preservation
  aspects of the service and applied mainly to internal processes. \nIn January 2024,
  the EDC was accepted onto the FAIR-IMPACT repository support programme which aims
  to help repositories support the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable
  principles.  As part of the EDC’s FAIR-IMPACT action plan policies and practices
  are being reviewed with a FAIR perspective. \nThis poster will discuss these two
  approaches, their synergies and differences in supporting the creation of polices
  & procedures with FAIR principles or preservation in mind and how these two approaches
  have led to a better service. Current observations are below. \n(1) There is a different
  level of granularity and scale between preservation and FAIR: the FAIR principles
  start at the dataset level; most preservation repositories will deal with collections
  of objects. \n(2) Both approaches stress the importance of understanding the licenses
  connected to the content and that the descriptive metadata ensures that objects
  can be retrieved and understood, there is more emphasis in the FAIR resources on
  common domain ontologies/vocabularies whereas preservation resources discuss the
  importance of the knowledge level of the designated community.  \n(3) Trust in the
  repository and resource are important, FAIR principles have more emphasis on machine
  retrieval and hence how can the repository demonstrate trust through its API. \nFor
  the EDC, being able to preserve the collection for the long-term so that it is usable
  in the future and ensuring that the datasets within the collection are FAIR are
  equal priorities and using these approaches to focus on different aspects has improved
  the service."
