abstract: "The Michigan Digital Preservation Network (MDPN) received an [implementation
  grant][1] from the United States Institute for Museum and Library Services to demonstrate
  a production-scale statewide digital preservation service focused on reducing barriers
  to participation for small and under-resourced cultural memory institutions (including
  community archives, historical societies, museums, and public libraries) by leveraging
  the newly-rearchitected LOCKSS 2.0/[LAAWS (LOCKSS Architected as Web Services)][2]
  software and [DART (Digital Archivist's Resource Tool)][3], an easy-to-use packaging
  tool from APTrust. Together, LAAWS and DART foster greater local control over the
  network infrastructure and make depositing content easier for users with little-to-no
  technical skill. By contributing to this centralized statewide preservation service,
  member institutions avoid redundant efforts, share resources, and make preservation
  more affordable for all.\n\nThis lightning talk centers on learnings from Phase
  One of our grant, which focused on identifying five geographically distributed LOCKSS
  server hosts, testing the new LAAWS documentation and installing the software, configuring
  DART, creating a deposit pathway between DART and LOCKSS, running deposit tests
  with partners, and documenting any challenges. Key takeaways include balancing aspirational
  vision with “on-the-ground” needs and costs, the importance of approaching “non-traditional”
  partners, managing relationships with collaborators, the value and challenges of
  local control, and how a network centered on cooperation, trust, and support can
  create easier “on ramps” to preservation and empower institutions to take more ownership
  of digital preservation. \n\nThe MDPN is - by all accounts from the LOCKSS Program
  - the first preservation network to use the LAAWS software across our entire production
  network infrastructure, and other institutions may find our experience useful. Although
  this case study focuses on our work in Michigan, the outcomes are relevant to a
  broad audience and could be replicated in many different contexts.\n\n\n  [1]: https://imls.gov/sites/default/files/project-proposals/LG-252394-OLS-22-full-proposal.pdf\n
