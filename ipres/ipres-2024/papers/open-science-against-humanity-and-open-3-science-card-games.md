abstract: "Engagement with Open Science and digital preservation can present a challenge
  because of their (perceived) abstract and theoretical nature. The GHOST (Games of
  Horror in Open Science Training) Collective uses gamification to lower this barrier
  and spark interest in these topics with researchers and other practitioners. Because
  many Open Science concepts are concerned with digital preservation, the following
  GHOST games are very applicable and inspirational to the iPRES audience. \n\n[Open
  Science Against Humanity][1] is based on the Cards Against Humanity gameplay concept.
  Players hold several cards in their hands that can be matched to the prompts on
  the table. The funniest or most on-fleek response to each prompt ‘wins’; the winning
  player gets to keep the prompt. Whoever has won the most rounds at the end, wins
  the game. The prompts and responses are all related to several Open Science aspects,
  including the preservation of data and software and the significant effort associated
  with it - something that all digital preservationalists will recognise. Players
  are encouraged to make humorous moves but also look up and discuss the meaning of
  cards or terms they do not know and thus learn about various aspects of Open Science\n\n[Open
  <3 Science][2] is more content-focused. Players still hold several cards in their
  hands and get prompts on the table, but they are encouraged to find the best match
  based on factual and/or practical content. The prompts are about Open Science principles,
  while the response cards contain Open Science concepts, including a brief explanation
  and a QR code that leads to bibliographic source material where players can find
  more in-depth explanations about the concept. Players are encouraged to discuss
  which response is the best match to the prompt, based on what they learned about
  the concepts at hand. Also here, there are many concepts that digital preservationalists
  will know, from licences and digital sovereignty to labour-intensiveness and community.\n\nIn
  the session, players are invited to try both games in several groups. Each game
  takes approximately 20 minutes to play, depending on the discussions. Players can
  walk in and out freely.\n\n\n  [1]: https://github.com/ghostCollective/OpenScienceAgainstHumanity\n
