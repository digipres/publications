abstract: "This poster presents the work of Archives & Special Collections (ASC) at
  the University of Glasgow, on the quarantine, preservation, long- and short-term
  retention conditions of computer storage media that are acquired as part of archival
  collections. Quarantine and condition checks are a crucial part of the preservation
  process, ensuring that newly acquired storage media do not introduce contaminants
  that could harm existing collections; and that computer storage is stored, handled,
  and transported in a way that minimises the risk of damage or data loss.\n\nThe
  poster covers requirements and recommendations for five broad categories of storage
  media typically found in archival collections: magnetic disks, floppy disks, optical
  media, cassettes and tapes, and solid state. For each category, information is provided
  on the types of media covered as well as recommendations on the optimal environmental
  conditions for long-term storage. Further guidelines cover various aspects of proper
  media handling, best ways to safely store, visual inspections, transportation, acclimatisation,
  and labelling. \n\nThis work collates and distils relevant information in British
  Standards BS-4783; includes updates and guidelines from the digital preservation
  and archiving community; and incorporates previously unpublished practice and expertise
  amassed in the 25 years since ASC began to collect computer storage media. It serves
  as a valuable resource for anyone involved in the acquisition, storage, and preservation
  of computer storage media in archival collections. It provides clear guidelines
  and recommendations, ensuring the long-term preservation and accessibility of our
  digital heritage."
