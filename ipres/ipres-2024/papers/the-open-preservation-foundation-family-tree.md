abstract: "The Open Preservation Foundation (known to most as the OPF) supports and
  hosts a number of core open source tools (https://openpreservation.org/tools/) and
  digital preservation initiatives (https://openpreservation.org/projects/) that underpin
  many digital preservation solution, activities and workflows. Although you may not
  be aware of it, there are multiple digital preservation solutions available to the
  community that have, somewhere under the bonnet, an OPF gismo. The chances are,
  if you’re running any sort of digital preservation workflow, you’re using something
  supported by the OPF whether you know it or not. \n\nAnd that’s a problem. People
  don’t know.\n\nOpen source is not free. It costs an ever-increasing amount to keep
  these tools alive and up-to date. Thanks to our members (https://openpreservation.org/membership/meet-our-members/)
  and the occasional donation (https://openpreservation.org/donate/) we have managed
  to keep the lights on, but it’s tight. We want to do more than just keep things
  going as they are… And to do that we need more resources.\n\nIf everyone who uses
  an OPF gismo at their institution (either directly, or indirectly through a third-party
  product) contributed we could do so, so much more.\n\nThis poster will show a family
  tree of OPF products, where they’re used, how often they’re downloaded, and just
  how much they’re emmeshed into the digital preservation ecosphere.\n\nWe want people
  to know that what they’re doing digital preservation wise is supported by the OPF
  before we start holding out the hat.\n\n(yes, this is a thinly disguised membership
  drive and plea for funds)"
