abstract: Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Adobe Firefly, and Sora are used to
  create new or adapted digital content. Sometimes the AI tools are used for creative
  purposes; other times, they can be used to mislead the viewer. The Coalition for
  Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) created a specification where metadata
  identifying the AI provenance of a fileâ€™s creation is embedded in the file. This
  presentation will demonstrate how common technical characterization and metadata
  extraction tools such as ExifTool, Tika, and others can be used to extract C2PA
  metadata and other provenance metadata to identify how a file was created, and created
  using which GenAI tool.  It will also demonstrate what the tools do ***not*** capture.
