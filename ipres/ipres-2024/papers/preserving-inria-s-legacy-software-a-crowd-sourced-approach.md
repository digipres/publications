abstract: "The present article discusses the efforts initiated by Software Heritage
  and the Inria Alumni Network to carry out a large-scale identification and preservation
  effort of the historical software artifacts created by Inria, the French National
  Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology. In an attempt to scale
  up a work-intensive process, the authors have turned to a crowd-sourced approach,
  with the first step consisting of better identifying Inria's software heritage.
  \nMore specifically, the article discusses the outcomes of a survey sent to current
  and past Inria employees. Its aim was to identify landmark legacy software products
  of the institute, available source codes, and possible contributors to a future
  collective archiving effort. \nUnsurprisingly, the survey found that older software
  pieces are less likely to be identified, with only a small subset of early-age Inria
  software production being reported in the survey. The availability of associated
  source codes also varies, with older software being more likely to have partially
  or completely lost source code, or to be stored on obsolescent media. Source code
  from recent software however is more likely to be available on modern collaborative
  platforms like Github or Gitlab, ensuring safe archiving via the Software Heritage
  universal archive.\nIn conclusion, the Inria survey confirms the urgent need to
  identify and preserve historical software items, especially those from the earlier
  decades which are at higher risk to be definitively lost if no preservation effort
  is made. We believe that, due to the broad scale and breadth of this effort, the
  lessons learned will be of interest to other institutions and software preservation
  initiatives.\nAs a next step, we plan to set up a dedicated framework to empower
  Inria alumni to contribute to the preservation of the legacy codes, and we call
  on other institutions to join in this effort, paving the way for many other crowd-sourcing
  source code preservation initiatives."
