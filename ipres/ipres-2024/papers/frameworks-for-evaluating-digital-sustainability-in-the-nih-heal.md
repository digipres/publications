abstract: Distributed research data ecosystems such as the NIH HEAL Data Ecosystem
  (HDE) lack a singular, cohesive framework for assessing their long-term sustainability.
  Research data ecosystems like the HDE provide a central data-discovery portal (similar
  to a data catalog); however, ecosystem architecture design relies on independently-managed
  data repositories with disparate architectures and governance frameworks. These
  types of systems tend not to fit neatly into existing digital sustainability frameworks
  such as the NDSA Levels of Preservation. In addition, most digital preservation
  literature tends to focus on the sustainability of *centralized* data archives rather
  than *distributed* data ecosystems. We propose that the sustainability of distributed
  research ecosystems may be evaluated by integrating concepts from existing digital
  preservation assessment frameworks standards that, in combination, address many
  of the digital sustainability factors that apply to organizational, repository,
  and dataset levels of granularity within a distributed system. We experiment with
  two such possible frameworks. First, the Digital Preservation Coalitionâ€™s Rapid
  Assessment model includes several metrics that cover organizational/repository *architecture
  and governance* and could be extended to apply to a distributed data ecosystem.
  Second, the relatively recent FAIR data principles provide guidance for evaluating
  ecosystem practices at the *dataset level*. This exploratory paper aims to spark
  discussion and additional research around how best to create and implement efficient
  frameworks for evaluating digital sustainability in a data ecosystem that depends
  on non-centralized architecture and governance.
