abstract: "In 2020, EPFL introduced [ACOUA][1], a dedicated service designed to manage
  'cold' datasets, such as supplementary data for articles and doctoral theses, completed
  research projects, or data retained following the closure of a lab or the departure
  of a researcher. \n\nInitially, the project aimed to address both dissemination
  and long-term preservation needs. Yet, following the tender process, the implemented
  service is solely oriented towards preservation. Consequently, ACOUA is a ‘dark’
  archive, accessible only to authenticated users. This makes it challenging to communicate
  to researchers the full value of the service.\n\nOverall, ACOUA enables to instate
  robust and OAIS-compliant workflows from data ingestion and curation to audit and
  retrieval, backed by detailed documentation and dedicated support for end-users.
  \nHowever, feedback from researchers emphazises the crucial importance of '[FAIRification][2]'
  for preserved objects.\n\nThis poster outlines the challenges encountered, strategies
  applied, and effective solutions implemented to meet the FAIR principles. \n\nHighlingts
  of the state-of-the-art include: \n \n\nFINDABLE \n\nA locally developed DataCite
  v.4.4 metadata generator streamlines the process of adding the metadata files to
  preserved objects. \n\n \nACCESSIBLE \n\nEach preserved object is assigned a unique
  DataCite DOI. \nPre-signed URLs enable the public access to datasets from ACOUA.\nA
  specially developed connector facilitates the automatic transfer of datasets from
  ACOUA to Zenodo. \n\n \nINTEROPERABLE \n\nCurrently, we maintain a basic OAI-PMH
  repository. \n\n\nREUSABLE \n\nLicenses and readme files are mandatory in ACOUA.
  \nDROID characterization and JHOVE validation of file formats are integrated into
  the process. \nA checksum check ensures the integrity of retrieved objects. \n\n
  \nNevertheless, more needs to be done to reach full FAIRness. \nThe poster also
  introduces new developments being considered for future work. Examples include,
  but are not limited to: \n\nUse features of the preservation tool to convert files
  to open formats at ingestions time (SIP), or to prevent obsolescence by evolving
  file formats on AIP/DIP copies. \nExplore existing ontologies for specific data
  collections within ACOUA. \nIntegrate the linked data version of PRONOM, when available.
  \n\nOur ultimate goal is to establish ACOUA as a '[FAIR over time][3]' and trustworthy
  repository, for an enlarged community of re-users.\n\n\n  [1]: https://actu.epfl.ch/news/acoua-a-new-archive-for-preservation-of-research-d/\n
