abstract: 'How do we cope with growing collections and complexity when our budgets
  are not able to keep up? How do we learn about the formats and software we care
  for? How can we find the information we need to improve our workflows and services?
  Since at least 2004 [1], the iPRES community has been well aware of the need to
  address this challenge together. But in the years since then, a succession of projects
  and proposals have come and gone [2], undermined by the institutional and financial
  constraints we operate under. Given the realities of the situation, how can we improve
  our digital preservation practices?


  The "Registries of Good Practice" Project is a two-year collaboration between the
  Digital Preservation Coalition and Yale University Library, aiming to explore new
  ways to make the most of the sources of practical knowledge we have, without demanding
  large-scale change or expensive infrastructure. This workshop will present our prototypes
  for searching across format registries and for finding relevant publications, our
  approach to sustainable design and our vision for building a shared understanding
  of the landscape of registries and records relevant to digital preservation.


  This will be followed by hands-on exploration of our new tools, to help attendees
  understand the range and coverage of the available registries, and learn new ways
  to find relevant records of technology and practice. This will help us to gather
  the user feedback that is critical to the success of the project and steer our future
  work. We will also use this workshop to document the wide range of records and registries
  that the digital preservation community depends on. This will help us build a better
  shared understanding of the current state of digital preservation, and of the wider
  landscape of information sources that we can all take advantage of and contribute
  to.
