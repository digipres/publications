abstract: "This poster will outline the ways in which Western Front Society, an artist-run
  centre based in Vancouver, BC, Canada, has developed and implemented digital preservation
  strategies, and how the work that has been done is applicable and beneficial for
  the broader non-profit arts sector in British Columbia and beyond. The first section
  of the poster will focus on the migration of digital assets to Collective Access,
  and how that system was customized to manage the Western Front archives, including
  digital assets (video, audio, images) and cataloging works and collections using
  the VRA Core principles. Then, the poster will outline the recent digital records
  management developments at Western Front, including email archiving using ePADD,
  web archiving using Conifer, and policy development, all of which is being designed
  to share with similar organizations dealing with arts and artistsâ€™ archives. \n\nThis
  submission will be of interest for iPres attendees who work in organizations that
  struggle with funding and/or staffing resources, as it allows for an opportunity
  to speak about the challenges of small organizations dealing with idiosyncratic
  digital archives. Our work in this area began with a video digitization project
  and has grown into a website redesign, database migration, and a file server reorganization.
  \n\nViewers will be able to interact with the poster through screenshot images from
  our various platforms (Collective Access, ePADD, Conifer), and can watch embedded
  samples from our historic videotape archives."
