abstract: 'Why bring Doctor Who and the TARDIS into a discussion about data in archives?
  One, because it’s fun, and two, because this is a story about time travel, collaboration,
  and rescue. For decades, the Doctor has been traveling through time to perform quirky
  and creative rescue missions. Like historical datasets, each adventure presents
  unique challenges, but one thing remains constant: the Doctor works best with others,
  and the same is true of data rescue, which requires expertise in archives, data,
  and the related subject matter. Discovering usable, historical data in an archives
  can feel as delightful and magical as the best episodes of Doctor Who. It can also
  be as tedious and frustrating as the worst episodes, but like all good science fiction,
  even the worst bits pose illuminating questions.


  How do current concepts of data and scholarship compare to historical ones? How
  do we find data that wasn’t labeled as data? How do we find data that wasn’t *thought
  of* as data? Once we find archival data, how do we transform it for reuse and analysis?
  What can historical data teach us about current best practices for documentation
  and vice versa?  Our research questions and knowledge structures determine what
  data will be acquired, how it will be arranged and analyzed, and also through what
  mechanisms it will be interpreted in the archives. Understanding all of this is
  integral to understanding how the data can be reused.


  This panel discussion will bring together archivists, librarians, and data service
  specialists to share their experiences finding, stewarding, and using data in archives
  - the successes, frustrations, discoveries, pitfalls, and unanswered questions.
  Together, we will explore possible solutions to the challenges of bridging data
  science and archives such as: identifying search terms that might indicate data;
  inferring missing context about standard research practices at the time data was
  collected; finding data in unexpected places like annotations and correspondence;
  working across datasets while preserving document order and fragile materials; extracting
  data from handwritten narrative text, symbols, and drawings; working through historical
  challenges like species names that change over time; and, making human-readable
  data machine-readable.'
