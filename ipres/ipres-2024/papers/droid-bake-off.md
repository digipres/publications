  and extracting key metadata, developed by The National Archives (UK).   It has widely
  used in archive organisations handling digital materials and in this demonstration,
  the Product Owner for DROID will demonstrate the usage of DROID to extract information
  about the supplied file corpus and prepare the files for preservation. Some tips
  and tricks for less-used features (such as easy command-line usage) could be demonstrated
  too.
