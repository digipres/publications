abstract: In recent years, Europe has witnessed several incidents involving high-ranking
  political officeholders using text and instant messages for official business, with
  subsequent challenges in retrieving these messages at a later stage. Prompted by
  these events, the State Archives of Belgium embarked on a mission to identify measures
  to safeguard the nation's collective memory – increasingly shaped by alternative
  archive types like mobile messages – and to ensure accountability of elected officials
  in both the short and long term. This paper outlines the findings of this endeavor.
  After a brief introduction and summary on the emergence of text and instant messaging
  as pivotal communication tools, we first assess their suitability for policy-making
  dialogue. Then follows an exploration of the preservation challenges the medium
  presents, both in a general context and specifically within Belgium, and of some
  strategies that can be employed to mitigate these challenges. In the conclusion,
  we summarise and put forward additional steps that archives can take to ensure the
  preservation of text messages by political officeholders, and briefly contemplate
  on the disclosure of these messages to the public in the short and long run.
