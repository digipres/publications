abstract: "To effectively manage their distributed digital preservation network, digital
  archivists should be able to answer the following questions at any time:\n- Are
  my collections intact and replicated at the intended sites?\n- Is the preservation
  network working properly? (Are all nodes operational and communicating correctly
  with each other?)\n- Have any copies ever needed repair ?\nMoreover, archivists
  also need to keep a complete history of their preservation network, ensuring that
  every action can be traced and used for auditing purposes.\nIn this lightning talk,
  I will explain how we implemented our dashboard solution to ensure enduring observability
  in a distributed preservation network, highlighting its key features.\nWhile the
  solution is applicable to any digital preservation network, I will illustrate it
  on the specific use case of SAFE PLN, a LOCKSS-based preservation network operated
  by seven university libraries, which celebrates its 10th anniversary this year.
  \nIn SAFE PLN, content is automatically collected from the institutional repositories
  of the 7 participating universities and distributed to preservation nodes across
  Europe and Canada.\nCopies are then regularly verified and automatically repaired
  using the LOCKSS technology developed at Stanford University. This open-source software
  was specifically designed to secure many distributed copies of digital archives
  and guarantee their integrity over the very long term. \nBy design, the peer-to-peer
  architecture of a LOCKSS network makes it truly decentralized and highly resistant
  to internal and external attacks. \nBut for the same reason, it's also difficult
  to monitor the status of the preservation network.\nOur open source dashboard solution
  based on Grafana provides each network member with global and detailed views of
  the network status, enabling each participant to track the status of their archived
  copies in real time. Problems in the network are also detected and reported instantly,
  enabling us to react quickly.\nBy ensuring observability and transparency, our dashboard
  contributes to making preservation networks more efficient, and brings greater peace
  of mind to all those concerned with protecting digital assets. \nOur solution has
  already been adopted by the Alabama Digital Preservation Network and is currently
  being deployed at the Michigan Digital Preservation Network."
