abstract: With an exemplary donation, the Bibliothèque nationale de France is refining
  its preservation policy in the field of graphic works intended for printing. The
  donation consists of posters produced by graphic designer Sébastien Marchal, accompanied
  by preparatory stages (sketches) and final versions for printing entirely dematerialized.
  The article will show how the preservation policy is developed, based on close collaboration
  with the donor and those involved in documentary policy at BnF. It will also outline
  the strategies deployed to meet the immediate expectations of researchers with technically
  non managed data.
