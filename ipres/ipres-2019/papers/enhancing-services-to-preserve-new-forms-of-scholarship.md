abstract: The advance in technologies for publishing digital scholarship has outpaced
  the development of technologies for reliably preserving it. Authors and publishers
  are creating increasingly sophisticated products without realizing that some of
  their enhancement choices might put preservability--and valuable scholarship--at
  risk. The poster describes the in-progress work and findings of a collaboration
  between preservation organizations, libraries, and publishers that are creating
  enhanced digital publications. The work aims to identify what can be effectively
  preserved with existing technologies, and to produce a recommended set of practices
  to help authors and publishers prioritize and plan their enhanced digital products
  for maximum preservability.
