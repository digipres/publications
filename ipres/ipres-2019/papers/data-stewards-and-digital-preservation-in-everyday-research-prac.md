abstract: Data Stewards at TU Delft promote digital preservation by incorporating
  actions in everyday research practice. Typical activities include requirement scoping,
  tool selection and policy drafting, all of which are tailored to a specific group,
  project or faculty. Here we discuss the situation of the Data Stewards within the
  university and examples of preservation work, including the creation of data repositories
  and a trial of Webrecorder.
