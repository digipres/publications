abstract: In the open access environment, many textual resources have become available
  in the PDF format on the Web. This research aims to survey PDF files in Japanese
  institutional repositories (IRs) to address the problems encountered during their
  longterm preservation. With that aim, 1.5 million PDF files collected from Japanese
  IRs were analyzed with regard to file format, encryption, and metadata. Most PDF
  files did not conform to PDF/A. A total of 30.5% of PDFs were encrypted and many
  PDFs did not have embedded metadata. These results imply that PDF files in Japanese
  IRs have several serious problems for their long-term preservation.
