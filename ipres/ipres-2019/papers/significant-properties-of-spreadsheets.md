abstract: In this extended abstract, the Open Preservation Foundation’s Archives Interest
  Group reports on our ongoing investigation of significant properties of spreadsheets.
  Using the InSPECT methodology for investigating significant properties of electronic
  content, our goal is to get hands-on experience in investigating the significant
  properties of deposited spreadsheets by adding a Spreadsheet Testing Report to the
  InSPECT Testing Reports lore. An additional result of the AIG investigation is a
  Spreadsheet Complexity Analyser tool that extracts spreadsheet- specific properties
  and can be used to calculate the complexity of a spreadsheet based on the values
  of those properties.
