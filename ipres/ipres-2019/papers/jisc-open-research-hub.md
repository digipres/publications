abstract: 'Jisc’s Open Research Hub (JORH) integrates a number of repository, preservation,
  reporting and storage platforms as a one stop shop for researchers and research
  managers. The service offers both open source and proprietary systems and allows
  data and metadata to be shared openly if required. The platform has been developed
  through years-long consultation with the UK HE research sector and sector bodies,
  along with contributions from both in-house Jisc and third-party experts. And was
  launched in July 2018.

  The need for such a solution has arisen from the sector’s desires to achieve several,
  shared aims, including: greater collaboration; tackling the reproducibility crisis;
  enabling better research; enabling a better user experience; and meeting funder
  requirements.

  Jisc’s custom-built repository—the Open Research Repository—is part of the Jisc
  Open Research Hub. It’s built upon an extensive data model and rich messaging layer,
  providing users with a clean, simple, and easy-to-learn interface for the deposit,
  approval, and discovery of a range of outputs. In particular it allows for a seamless
  end to end experience for the user; from deposit straight through to preservation.

  Jisc’s position in the UK higher education / research sector, as well as the scale
  of the service provides us with many domain-specific insights to share with iPRES
  delegates, ranging from the broad methods mentioned above, down to individual design
  decisions informed by our research and domain expertise.'
