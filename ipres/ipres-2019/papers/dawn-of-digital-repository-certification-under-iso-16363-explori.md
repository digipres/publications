abstract: The dawn of Trustworthy Digital Repository Certification under the ISO 16363:2012
  standard is on the horizon. Across the digital preservation community, institutions
  are eager to learn more about the processes of preparing for and undergoing an ISO
  16363 audit from an accredited third-party organization. As the first ISO 16363
  audits in the world have been performed, repositories want to learn value and benefit
  that certification provides. This panel features representatives from three different
  repositories representing three countries with distinct collections, designated
  communities, organizational infrastructures, and unique challenges. Institutions
  represented on the panel have either recently achieved certified or are currently
  undergoing an ISO 16363 audit. This panel will explore each repositoryâ€™s experience
  during, leading up to, and following certification. The panel will include a representative
  from the accredited external auditing body who has performed these audits to respond
  to audience questions about the audit process. Panelists from repositories will
  present varying perspectives on the future of digital repository certification,
  the role of digital preservation standards, and approaches to implementation. All
  panelists will present arguments, concerns, and criticisms regarding the ISO 16363
  standard and existing methods of repository assessment.
