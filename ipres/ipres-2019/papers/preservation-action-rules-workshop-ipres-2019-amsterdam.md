abstract: 'The Preservation Action Registries project (http://parcore.org) is developing
  a common and consistent way to describe and execute preservation policies and actions
  at a technical level. An initial data model has been created which defines a human
  and machine readable way of describing preservation actions and the associated business
  rules that together make up preservation policies.

  Using a skill acquisition technique borrowed from the medical profession (See One,
  Do One, Teach One) this workshop will lead participants through a three step process,
  intended to improve the participants ability to develop and describe their own digital
  preservation policy in both human and machine-readable forms. The workshop will
  help participants to better express and share preservation policies in a concise,
  comprehensive and unambiguous way. Through the participants activities in the workshop,
  the PAR data model will be tested, validated and further improvements identified.

  Participants will be introduced to the PAR project and data model, using examples
  of working preservation actions and business rules. In smaller group, participants
  will be led through the process of describing a new preservation policy using the
  PAR data model. Finally, groups will present their work to the other groups.'
