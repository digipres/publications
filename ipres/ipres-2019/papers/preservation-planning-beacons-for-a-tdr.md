abstract: In order to preserve digital objects for the long term repositories need
  to choose a preservation strategy. For new emerging types of media this is a challenge.
  This paper describes how various cases occurred at the Netherlands Institute for
  Sound and Vision. It shows how preservation planning helps management in putting
  these matters in the right context and taking informed decisions based on knowing
  what we know now. It concludes with an overview of the content of a Preservation
  Plan, as has been implemented in practice.
