abstract: Virus checking is an established process in most pre-ingest digital preservation
  workflows. It is typically included as part of a general threat model response and
  there has to date been relatively little research into the virus checking function
  specifically within a long term context. The British Library recently began a small
  research project to explore this issue, using data from a legacy digital collection
  established by the ‘Flashback’ project and supplementary data provided by the UK
  Web Archive. Our poster presents this research and findings to date, raising questions
  about the overhead of virus checking at scale, when organizations should virus-check
  content, and the legacy capabilities of anti-virus software.
