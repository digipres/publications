abstract: Sustainability has been a key focus for the digital preservation community
  in recent years, but we have mostly focused on issues such as the sustainability
  of systems and funding. We cannot, however, be successful as a community without
  also developing a robust and skilled workforce. This paper will examine trends in
  workforce development in digital preservation and suggest steps forward we should
  take as a community.
