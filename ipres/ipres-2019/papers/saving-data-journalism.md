abstract: While dynamic and interactive Web applications are becoming increasingly
  common to convey news and stories to people all around the world, their technological
  complexity makes it hard to archive and preserve such applications, and as such,
  they are being lost. We present ReproZip-Web, an open-source prototype aimed at
  saving these news applications from extinction. ReproZip-Web leverages ReproZip,
  a computational reproducibility tool, and Webrecorder, a tool for recording Web
  resources, to automatically and transparently capture and replay dynamic Websites.
  The prototype creates a bundle that contains all the information needed to reproduce
  a news application, and its lightweight nature makes it ideal for distribution and
  preservation. We will present our ongoing work on the prototype, andalso discuss
  some use cases and avenues for future development.
