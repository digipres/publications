abstract: Cloud services have become the increasingly dominant paradigm for many other
  types of IT-based services; why not for digital preservation? Cloud services are
  by now a familiar, though not mature, part of the digital preservation landscape.
  It is worth considering further how commercial cloud services are currently or might
  prospectively be used for digital preservation, as well as the implications for
  memory institutions, individually and collectively, if digital preservation shifts
  primarily in that direction. This panel will offer contrasting institutional perspectives
  on the potential or the perils of the cloud for digital preservation, featuring
  case studies on how memory institutions can leverage the cloud in deliberate and
  mission-supporting ways, and how some are working to build alternative, community-based
  infrastructures.
