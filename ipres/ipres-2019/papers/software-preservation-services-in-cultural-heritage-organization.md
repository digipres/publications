abstract: 'Preserving software is a prerequisite for preserving and providing access
  to digital cultural heritage and research. The recent formation of the Software
  Preservation Network (SPN) has provided momentum for a better understanding of the
  landscape of software preservation activities. This poster discusses preliminary
  results from a study undertaken by SPNâ€™s Research Working Group. Our specific research
  questions are: What software preservation services are cultural heritage professionals
  currently providing? What are the gaps in services? What are the opportunities for
  future service provision? Our Service Provider Study focuses on software preservation
  activities happening in libraries, archives and museums. This study will inform
  a foundational agenda that SPN members and other cultural heritage professionals
  can use to conduct further research on sustainable software preservation services.'
