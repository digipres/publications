abstract: This half day tutorial will provide participants with an introduction to
  the Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS) and the METS Primer [1].
  It will give a short basic overview of the standard and thoroughly explore different
  models of implementation using two different use cases. The METS schema is a standard
  for encoding descriptive, administrative, and structural metadata regarding objects
  within digital libraries as well as digital archives, expressed using the XML schema
  language of the World Wide Web Consortium. It is maintained by the METS Board and
  the METS Maintenance Activity is managed by the Library of Congress [2]..
