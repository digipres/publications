abstract: 'This workshop will update the community on the work of the Levels of Preservation
  (LoP) Reboot Working Group and engage with the participants to gather feedback on
  our work so far and what

  form the final product(s) should take. Updating the

  LoP will require a more dynamic user interface and

  user experience. Working with the participants, we

  will create a list of requirements and options for the

  final products. In addition, the workshop will discuss

  a methodology for keeping the LoP updated on an

  ongoing basis.
