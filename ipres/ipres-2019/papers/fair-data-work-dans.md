abstract: 'Ever since the origin of the FAIR data guiding principles, various members
  of the DANS staff have been involved in a variety of activities on thinking about
  their implications and implementing them. This paper presents an overview of the
  fruits of our work so far and sketches our ideas for the years to come. We were
  involved as co-authors of the original publication on the FAIR principles, developed
  and tested

  FAIR metrics, worked on tools to rate the FAIRness of datasets, on a FAIR checklist
  for researchers, we evaluated how our own data archives score on FAIRness, we compared
  the principles to the requirements of the Data Seal of Approval and the CoreTrustSeal,
  explored the applicability of the FAIR principles to Software Sustainability, prepared
  guidelines for FAIR data management, and we lead the prominent Horizon 2020 FAIRsFAIR
  project in the context of the European Open Science Cloud.'
