abstract: 'Most initiatives to build digital preservation programs focus almost exclusively
  on technical issues: hardware, software, and information architecture. Our panel
  will instead discuss the organizational, functional, and staff-related questions
  that needed to be answered in order for three archives at international multilateral
  organizations to evolve their programs to support digital records. A significant
  portion of the panel will be dedicated to comparing and contrasting our challenges,
  approaches, and successes.Keywords â€“ digital preservation, capacity planning, organizational
  issues, leveraging expertise, international organizations'
