abstract: Through four decades of digital initiatives and collecting programs the
  U.S. Library of Congress has built up a sizable digital collection. In support of
  long-term management of this digital content, in 2018 staff worked to review information
  about file extensions of content in the permanent digital collection through analysis
  of data in the institutionâ€™s primary digital content inventory system. This paper
  reports the results of this analysis and how these findings will inform the development
  of digital content management policy and practice at the institution.
