abstract: The digital preservation function in an academic research library is chiefly
  concerned with the ongoing access to its digital collections. This paper describes
  the work in developing a typology of digital collections at Hesburgh Libraries,
  University of Notre Dame, which serves as a framework for planning and building
  a sustainable Digital Preservation program.
