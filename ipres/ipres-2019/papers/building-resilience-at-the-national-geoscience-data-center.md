abstract: "The National Geoscience Data Center (NGDC) is the designated repository
  for the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) grant-funded Earth science data
  and holds the CoreTrustSeal certification. The NGDC is hosted by the British Geological
  Survey (BGS), which co-funds post-graduate research students through the BGS University
  Funding Initiative (BUFI) program. \nThis paper describes the research data management
  training (RDM) course developed and delivered by the NGDC to help instill good data
  management practices in our students from early on, and to strengthen the long-term
  quality of research data they generate and deposit with the NGDC. It also looks
  at how RDM training fits into the wider context of the NGDC modular digital preservation
  program, currently under development. \nThis paper is aimed at data repository managers
  and research data managers who provide user training in data management best practice
  and digital preservation. It is also suitable for postgraduate students interested
  in digital continuity and preservation of their research data."
