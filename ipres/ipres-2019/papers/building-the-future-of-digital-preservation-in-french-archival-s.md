abstract: Studied since the 1980s in French Archival services from a technical point
  of view, long term digital preservation strategy became a priority a few years ago
  in the context of Vitam program. The French Archive Interdepartmental Service, in
  partnership with the Vitam program team and the Ministries of Culture (National
  Archives), for Europe and Foreign Affairs and of Armed Forces, commissioned a study
  in 2018 about “ The long-term sustainability of digital information “. This collective
  work offers a modeling of digital preservation processes and an analysis of the
  skills and profiles needed to implement these processes, not only for the three
  ministries but for any archival service wishing to diagnose its maturity.
