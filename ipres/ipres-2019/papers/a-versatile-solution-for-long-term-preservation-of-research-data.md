abstract: 'Developed in the context of the 2017- 2020 Swiss national programme “Scientific
  information: Access, processing and safeguarding”, the DLCM solution (dlcm.ch) consists
  of an open and modular architecture for long-term preservation of research data.
  While being compliant with the OAIS standard, the proposed solution makes the deposit
  of research

  data straightforward, yet allows the qualification of the submitted formats so as
  to inform users of the risks incurred on the long term.'
