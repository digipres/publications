abstract: Fedora is an open source repository platform for managing and preserving
  digital objects. While Fedora has always been associated with digital preservation,
  recent releases have focused on exposing linked data and aligning with modern web
  standards. The Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL), which defines a shared approach
  to file hierarchy for long-term preservation, provides an opportunity to bring the
  focus back to digital preservation in Fedora. The OCFL supports application-independent,
  transparent file persistence that can be used to rebuild a repository in case of
  disaster. These features address the current needs of the Fedora community, so a
  group of Fedora committers met in person to design a version of Fedora that implements
  the OCFL. This will be the focus of the next major release, Fedora 6. 0. This paper
  introduces the OCFL and describes the proposed design for Fedora 6. 0, including
  the next steps for development and implementation.
