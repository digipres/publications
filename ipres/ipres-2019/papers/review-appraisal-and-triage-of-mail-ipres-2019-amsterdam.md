abstract: This full-day tutorial will focus on open-source software (OSS) tools and
  methods for libraries, archives and museums (LAMs) to identify email in born-digital
  collections, review email sources for sensitive or restricted materials, and perform
  appraisal and triage tasks to identify and annotate records. We will specifically
  explore products of the Review, Appraisal and Triage of Mail (RATOM) projectâ€™s use
  of machine learning to separate records from non-records, along with natural language
  processing methods to identify entities of interest within those records. In addition
  to gaining hands-on experience using the tools, participants will also learn about
  the rationale for their development, how they relate to other available software,
  and how processing of email can fit into larger digital curation workflows. We will
  conclude with a discussion of implications for participants in their own institutions.
