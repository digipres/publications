abstract: Digital preservation is a continuous activity requiring long-term effort,
  the lack of which presents risks for data falling behind in maintenance, representation,
  functionalities, and long-term safeguarding. However, contingencies in a preservation
  pathway can change quickly. Going to the rescue of data at preservation risk requires
  potentially costly and time consuming strategies. The ability to respond successfully
  is enhanced by planning an exit strategy for the data. We present two scenarios
  enacted in response to the closure of a distributed data preservation initiative
  and stress the importance of a prior “plan B” to digital preservation plans.
