abstract: This paper presents the newly available Micr’Olonys software-on-film digital
  archiving solution that builds on a multi-layered virtual machine, and microfilm,
  a proven medium with a life expectancy of 500 years. The passive digital preservation
  strategy it follows matches the features of a written form contrasting with current
  active strategies that rather compare to orality. Micr’Olonys stores digital files
  as 2D barcodes whose content can be restored, using any general-purpose computer
  and scanner, by implementing the procedure described in a self-contained bootstrap
  that spans a dozen human-readable pages including a simple 2-page algorithm. In
  the future, Micr’Olonys aims to become a powerful preservation tool for complex
  formats and software, as well as the access key to DNA digital storage to archive
  massive amounts of data.
