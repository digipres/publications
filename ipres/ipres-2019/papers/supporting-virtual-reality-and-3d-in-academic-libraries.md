abstract: Academic libraries are increasingly adopting virtual reality (VR) technologies
  for a variety of research and teaching purposes, yet there is a lack of clear guidance
  in the community on how to manage these technologies in effective and sustainable
  ways. In June 2018, the University of Oklahoma hosted the second of three forums
  on the topic of using 3D and VR for visualization and analysis in academic libraries,
  as part of the IMLS-funded project, Developing Library Strategy for 3D and Virtual
  Reality Collection Development and Reuse (LIB3DVR). This project uses nominal group
  technique to collect data from the invited experts (from diverse academic disciplines
  and institutional contexts) at the Forum to identify common preservation and curation
  challenges in the visualization and analysis of 3D data and the management of VR
  programs. This paper describes the findings of this project and outlines strategies
  and techniques for curating and preserving 3D/VR.
