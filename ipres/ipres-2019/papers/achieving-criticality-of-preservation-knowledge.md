abstract: 'The concerns of the digital preservation community are shared by those
  working in the nuclear field - preserving information for as long as it is required,
  taking into account the needs of diverse stakeholders, explaining needs to IT professionals,
  preserving data from legacy systems and obsolete media, managing accessibility and
  information security. Yet the length of time knowledge needs to be accessible and
  understandable, the accountability for public safety, and non-proliferation concerns
  present further challenges in the preservation of information related to nuclear
  science and its applications. Preservation efforts in this field must be approached
  and executed with these challenges in mind while also aligning with community good
  practices.

  Practitioners from the nuclear field will present their experiences and. the panel
  discussion will address collaboration and impediments, appraisal and records management
  in light of the length of time material must be available, and preservation approaches.
  The panel will demonstrate the ways in which those in the nuclear field benefit
  from and apply good preservation practices and highlight how practitioners in the
  nuclear field can contribute to the broader digital preservation community thus
  opening a dialogue on how we can progress together.'
