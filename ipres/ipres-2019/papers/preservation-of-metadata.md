abstract: "This paper focuses on strategies for preservation of metadata; one of the
  major topics in the creation of a new digital preservation strategy for the merged
  Royal Danish Library. Preservation of metadata is important to ensure preservation
  of all relevant information in order to be able to access digital objects in the
  future. This includes all kinds of metadata, which contributes to the understanding
  of an object, e.g. preservation metadata as well as descriptive metadata.\nThe need
  for metadata is commonly accepted, but it is not as commonly accepted that metadata
  need to be preserved to the same extent as files. There are many challenges due
  to the fact that metadata are often updated. This is probably one of the reasons
  why there exist numerous examples of metadata being under backup only and not under
  bit preservation. \nPreservation of metadata is not just needed for future access
  of the objects, but also for re-establishment of repository systems after major
  breakdowns â€“ or for establishment of a new repository as part of an exit strategy
  from a previous system. The latter case\nmay also mean that the metadata have to
  be structured in a way, which can be used by different systems supporting digital
  preservation.\nThis paper describes how the newly merged Royal Danish Library has
  created a digital preservation strategy to cope with these challenges, and discusses
  the background for choices made in this process."
