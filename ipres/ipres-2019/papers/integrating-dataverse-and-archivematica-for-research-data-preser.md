abstract: Scholars Portal sponsored Artefactual Systems Inc. to develop the ability
  for the preservation processing application Archivematica to receive packages from
  Dataverse, a popular repository platform for uploading, curating, and accessing
  research data. The integration was released as part of Archivematica 1.8 in November
  2018. This paper situates the integration project in the broader context of research
  data preservation; describes the scope and history of the project and the features
  and functionalities of the current release; and concludes with a discussion of the
  potential for future developments to meet additional use cases, service models and
  preservation approaches for research data.
