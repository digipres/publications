abstract: Practitioners generally agree that providing a service to enable opening
  and interacting with born digital objects in their “original” software is valuable
  for historians, researchers and the general public so that they can experience full-fidelity
  experiences of the objects. Enabling this has, to date, been a difficult, time-consuming,
  relatively resource intensive, and tedious. In this paper, we show how we are on
  the verge of creating a new method and series of tools to simplify and automate
  the process of interacting with digital objects in their original software and greatly
  reduce the time and resource costs of doing so. We outline the history of the developments
  in the areas of emulation and software preservation that we have built on and we
  outline the concept of this set of tools and processes we call the “Universal Virtual
  Interactor”. We also discuss how the UVI is being created, and finally we discuss
  how it may be improved upon in the future and how it may be implemented in access
  and discovery tools.
