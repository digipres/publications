abstract: The preservation of research data to enable replication and reuse is critically
  dependent on efficient, effective and sustainable data stewardship by the research
  communities. The certification of trustworthy data repositories (TDRs) custodian
  organizations that ensure data stewardship and longterm preservation by means of
  a standard such as the CoreTrustSeal is an established and recognized procedure
  to support long-term access to reusable data. Likewise, the FAIR Guiding Principles
  and the developing FAIR metrics have largely codified the contemporary discourse
  and policies on research data management and stewardship. The proximity of objectives
  between the CoreTrustSeal certification of TDRs and the implementation of FAIR Principles
  calls for a close examination of their overlaps and complementarities. In particular,
  the concept of FAIR data cannot be detached from the characteristics of the data
  infrastructure, the environment in which FAIR data objects reside. It is therefore
  necessary to examine, under which circumstances the assessment of FAIRness should
  be carried out at collectionor repository-level, and to what extent CoreTrustSeal
  certification can be considered positioning TDRs as enabling FAIR data.
