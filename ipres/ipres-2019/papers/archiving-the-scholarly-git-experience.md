abstract: Our poster will reflect our recent efforts to understand the workflows and
  policies needed for the long-term preservation of code, annotations, and other scholarly
  ephemera from Git hosting platforms. We undertook an environmental scan of the existing
  processes and tools for capturing and actively archiving Git data and their associated,
  supplemental materials. We will present the results of this broad environmental
  scan, covering a wide variety of approaches, organizations, and workflows that could
  possibly be used to create a baseline on which to build and expand archival tools.
  Our efforts are geared toward acquiring, archiving, and providing permanent access
  to source code, and the materials around it, and argue that the whole should be
  considered part of the scholarly record.
