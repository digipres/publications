abstract: This poster will highlight new features of the Web Curator Tool (WCT), added
  from January 2018 onwards through a collaboration between the National Library of
  New Zealand (NLNZ) and the National Library of the Netherlands (KB-NL). One of the
  themes from the collaboration has been to develop a modern fit-for-purpose WCT.
  This involves learning the lessons from previous developments, responding to recent
  trends in the web archiving community and completing a technical uplift. On this
  foundation a new, revamped WCT has been developed and released as version 2.x. As
  well as highlighting the latest developments the poster outlines the roadmap and
  community building planned for the WCT in the coming years.
