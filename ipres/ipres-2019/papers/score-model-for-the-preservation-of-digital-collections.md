abstract: The Score Model for the Preservation of Digital Collections is an online
  (www.scoremodel.org) self-evaluation tool for cultural heritage institutions which
  aims to help them with getting a grip on digital preservation. The idea and rationale
  behind the Score Model is that it can be easily used by smaller and less technically
  advanced organizations. It is therefore as jargon-free as possible and gives organizations
  hands-on advise on which issues should be tackled first. The Score Model has the
  form of an online tool in which the user has to register for an account. They then
  have to answer 56 questions - separated in seven ISO 16363 inspired clusters - which
  result in a final report. This report gives a comprehensive overview of how the
  user has scored for the different clusters and which issues the organization should
  tackle first. Additionally, the report gives an impression of how far the organization
  has advanced in becoming a Trusted Digital Repository in the form of qualifying
  for a Core Trust Seal.
