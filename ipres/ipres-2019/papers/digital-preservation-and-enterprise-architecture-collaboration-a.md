abstract: This paper examines a meeting of mindsets at the University of Melbourne,
  and how digital preservation and enterprise architecture have joined forces to meet
  goals of the universityâ€™s Digital Preservation Strategy 2015-2025. We identify the
  points of connection and similarities between digital preservation and enterprise
  architecture. We explore how a core foundation for university-wide infrastructure
  implementation is being achieved through effective collaboration between the Scholarly
  Services-based Digital Scholarship team at the university (the team responsible
  for driving digital preservation project work) and the Infrastructure Services-based
  Enterprise Architecture unit. We investigate the similarities and differences in
  approach for these two diverse business units within the university context and
  identify how collaboration between digital preservation and enterprise architecture
  can continue to drive mutually beneficial digital preservation operations at the
  university.
