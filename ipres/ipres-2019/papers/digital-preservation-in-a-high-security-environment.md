abstract: 'For the past five years, Princeton University Library – specifically the
  University Archives – has striven to create a robust digital preservation program
  for its born-digital and digitized records. Due to lack of time and available staff,
  the Library decided that a third party digital preservation service would be the
  best solution. It could be acquired relatively quickly, and it wouldn’t require
  asking for funding to hire multiple dedicated staff to build a home-grown digital
  preservation system. Obtaining buy-in from stakeholders and finding a service that
  met Princeton’s needs proved to be a challenge, especially due to the sensitivity
  of student records in the collections, which would require a high level of privacy
  and encryption key maintenance in addition to standard data integrity and preservation
  processing tools. Throughout 2018, Princeton worked to partner with a service previously
  unavailable due to University data sovereignty requirements – Arkivum’s Perpetua
  – and work began to develop a Princetonspecific solution that met the needs of the
  University: Most importantly, geographically dispersed cloud storage locations,
  Princeton-based control over data integrity and authenticity checks, an encryption
  key management system for student records maintained by the vendor but managed by
  repository staff, and a reliable and quick exit strategy.'
