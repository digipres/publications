abstract: "The Digital Preservation Storage Criteria (or “Criteria”) resulted from
  a community discussion at iPres 2015 on providing guidance to organizations that
  either use or provide digital preservation storage. First developed in 2016, they
  have been refined in iterative versions over the last three years based on feedback
  gathered at conference sessions and through a survey. The Criteria are intended
  to help with developing requirements for, or evaluations of, preservation storage
  solutions; to seed discussions about preservation storage; or to use within digital
  preservation instructional material. The latest version of the Criteria contains
  sixty-one criteria grouped into eight categories: content integrity, cost considerations,
  flexibility, information security, resilience, scalability & performance, support,
  and transparency. \nThe key new development since the Criteria was presented at
  the iPRES 2018 workshop is a usage guide, developed to accompany the Criteria. It
  includes sections on key topics to consider for preservation storage in addition
  to the Criteria: risk management, independence, elements in establishing bit safety,
  and cost considerations. The usage guide will be released publicly for review as
  one of the next steps in the project, along with developing version 4 of the Criteria
  and taking steps to further build the community around the Criteria."
