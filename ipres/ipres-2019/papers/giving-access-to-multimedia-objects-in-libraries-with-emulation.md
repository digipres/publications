abstract: The German National Library makes collected multimedia objects available
  onsite within emulated environments. The framework is based on Emulation as a Service
  and optimized for automatically handling big collections. The paper describes the
  development in a German research project and the practical integration in the access
  environment of the library. It also gives an overview of legal aspects related to
  the emulation framework.
