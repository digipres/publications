abstract: The Integrated Preservation Suite is an internally funded project at the
  British Library to develop and enhance the Library’s preservation planning capability,
  largely focussed on automation and addressing the Library’s heterogeneous collections.
  Through agile development practices, the project is iteratively designing and implementing
  the technical infrastructure for the suite as well as populating it with the content
  required for the infrastructure to work in a business environment. This paper provides
  an initial description of the suite’s architecture and supporting data model.
