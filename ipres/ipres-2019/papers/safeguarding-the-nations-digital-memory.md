abstract: This poster offers the iPRES community an interim update on work at The
  National Archives (UK) to develop a Dynamic Bayesian Network which describes and
  explains the complexity of the digital preservation risk environment. The intention
  of this project is to evaluate the applicability of a Bayesian statistical approach
  to support a risk-based approach to digital preservation. This would complement
  our existing standards-based approaches and support evidence led decision making
  by the archive. This poster focuses on the technical work undertaken so far during
  the project, highlighting the potential benefits of the approach and identifying
  areas for further investigation.
