abstract: For many memory institutions, policies, procedures, and practices are built
  on the realities of analog records. The belief that digital content can be appraised,
  acquired, described, and made accessible using the same methods as paper records
  can inhibit the development of end-to-end digital preservation programs. To start
  to address this challenge, I developed a collaborative model for digital knowledge
  transfer based on adult education theory. The model has shown great promise for
  building digital capacity, capability, and community amongst my colleagues at Library
  and Archives Canada. This paper outlines the concepts that drive the model, as well
  as the three steps that are required for its implementation. As analog preconceptions
  often influence the thinking of those who are responsible for relationships with
  records creators, as well as the acquisition and processing of digital content,
  such collaboration and capacity building is a necessity for the success of end-to-end
  digital preservation programs.
