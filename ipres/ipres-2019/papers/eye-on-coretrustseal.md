abstract: 'The CoreTrustSeal (CTS) is an accepted trustworthy digital Repository certification
  process for both, research data management and digital preservation communities
  alike. But does it build on concepts known and understood by both of these communities?
  We take an in-depth look at the CTS requirement Ro-Background Information/Context,
  in which the applicants are asked to define their Repository Type, Designated Community
  and Level of Curation Performed. By extracting information from the publicly available
  assessment reports and crosschecking these against available supporting information,
  we relect on CTS from three viewpoints: the process, the institutional, and the
  community view. We distill concrete recommendations, which will be fed back to the
  CTS Board as part of the 2019 public call for review.'
