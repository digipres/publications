abstract: this poster presents a concept of a preservation system for computations
  on High Performance Computing (HPC) resources. It covers some important challenges
  and possible solutions related to the preservation of scientific experiments on
  HPC systems for their further reproduction. Storage of the experiment as only a
  code with some related data is not completely enough for its future reproduction,
  especially in the long term. Preservation of the whole experimentâ€™s environment
  (operating system, used libraries, environment variables, input data, etc.) using
  containerization technology (e.g. Docker, Singularity) is proposed as a suitable
  solution for that. This approach allows to preserve an entire environment, but leaves
  a problem, how to deal with the commercial software that was used within the experiment.
  As a solution authors propose to replace during the preservation procedure all commercial
  software with their open source analogues, what should allow future reproduction
  of the experiment without any legal issues. The prototype of such a system was developed,
  the poster provides a scheme of the system and the first experimental results.
