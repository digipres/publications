abstract: 'Metadata is a fundamental component of all digital preservation activities.
  This half day workshop offers a space to explore and discuss preservation metadata.

  The workshop will be based on the community standards of PREMIS, METS and OCFL and
  facilitated by members of the boards of all three. This is the first time that the
  three boards have collaborated on such a session.

  The purpose of the workshop is to connect the maintainers of the standards with
  the digital preservation community and offer implementers of preservation metadata
  an opportunity to discuss issues, successes and future directions.'
