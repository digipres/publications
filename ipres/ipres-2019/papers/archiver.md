abstract: Do you need to acquire standards-based, cost-effective archiving and preservation
  services? Are ingest rates, data volume and long-term support important to you?
  The ARCHIVER project aims to introduce significant improvements in these areas of
  archiving and digital preservation services, supporting the IT requirements of European
  scientists developing end-to-end archival and preservation services for data generated
  in the context of scientific research. With a total procurement budget of 3.4 million
  euros, the project will use a Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) approach to competitively
  procure R&D services from firms in three stages covering design, prototyping and
  pilot, over a 3-year period (Jan 2019 - Dec 2021). The resulting services will become
  part of the catalogue of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) initiative funded
  by the European Commission (EC). This contribution will showcase the results obtained
  during the project phases up to iPRES2019, providing an overview of the PCP process
  for the supply side and how the wider demand side community can benefit from the
  ARCHIVER results through the ARCHIVER Early Adopters program.
