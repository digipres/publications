abstract: This paper describes a soon-to-be-concluded six-month project at Portico.
  The goal of this project is to attack preservation cost drivers with automated,
  data-driven analysis of problematic content, revamped policies and manual procedures,
  and targeted development of automated management and remediation tools. The desired
  outcome, in addition to more quickly ingesting content into the archive, is the
  most efficient, economical application possible of technical staff to the automation
  of problematic content handling, as well as a streamlining, rather than expansion,
  of manual production processes for content continually growing in quantity and complexity.
