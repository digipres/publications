abstract: Digital Preservation places a strong emphasis on building communities to
  share experiences and develop solutions. Traditionally these communities were built
  on geographic or functional alignment or created through external grant funded research
  activities. As commercial Digital Preservation products have emerged vendors have
  created User Groups for their customers that seek to fulfil this function. Using
  the lessons of the 11-year history of the Preservica User Group, this paper explores
  how these User Groups function and compares this to studies of User Groups in other
  domains.
