abstract: In 2018 and 2019, as part of the UK Legal Deposit Libraries’ sponsored ‘Emerging
  Formats’ project, the British Library’s digital preservation team a program of research
  into the preservation of new forms of content. One of these content types was eBooks
  published as Mobile Apps. Research considered a relatively small number of apps
  in an attempt to better understand the preservation challenges associated with them
  and make recommendations for a way forwards. It found that whilst the content landscape
  is extremely varied, the technical challenges are similar for both Android and Apple
  apps. The greatest challenges appear to lie in the acquisition and access areas,
  particularly in enabling delivery to appropriate rendering environments and devices,
  though other challenges remain around the use of device sensors and content stored
  on remote servers rather than the user’s device. Whilst these challenges may be
  surmountable with sufficient resource and investment, the lack of growth in this
  content area in recent years makes large scale investment questionable.
