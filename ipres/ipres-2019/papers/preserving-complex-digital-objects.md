abstract: This workshop addresses the opportunities and challenges generated by complex
  digital objects - objects created using innovative technologies - and current strategies
  for preserving them. The workshop will present a definition of complex digital objects
  with examples and an overview of the preservation challenges they pose, such as
  deciding what to collect and problem- solving for software and hardware dependencies.
  Using case studies, participants will identify and analyze a set of challenges to
  preserving actual works that UK cultural heritage institutions are looking to acquire.
  This will be done through small group exercises and will draw on approaches based
  on work carried out by Tate, the UK Legal Deposit Libraries (LDLs), and the Digital
  Preservation Coalition (DPC).
