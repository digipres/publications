abstract: The Integrated Preservation Suite is an internally funded project at the
  British Library to develop automated and scalable preservation planning capability
  for a highly diverse and growing digital collection. Core components include a technical
  knowledge base, a software repository, a policy and planning repository, and a preservation
  watch function, all accessed via a web-based Preservation Workbench and designed
  to integrate with any repository software through a modular API-based architecture.
  We will demonstrate work to date, showing how preservation plans can be constructed
  and populated for the formats currently supported.
