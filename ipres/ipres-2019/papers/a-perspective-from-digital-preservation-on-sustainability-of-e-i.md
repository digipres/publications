abstract: Much effort is expended on assuring sustainability of e-infrastructures
  and the services within them. Some of these services have a dimension of long-term
  preservation, in particular the infrastructure around persistent identifiers (PIDs).
  It is therefore worth asking whether established approaches to long-term digital
  preservation can offer insights into planning for sustainability. This paper examines
  some aspects of the OAIS Reference Model and their applicability to sustainability
  planning for e-infrastructures.
