abstract: Collection institutions (Libraries, Archives, Galleries, and Museums) are
  responsible for storing and preserving large amounts of digital data, which can
  range from historical/public figure records, to state or country- wide events. The
  ingest process often requires sifting through large amounts of data which may not
  always be sorted or categorized from the source/donor. It is possible to discover
  information that was not intended to be disclosed should the donor not be privy
  to the existence of said material. This issue is typically handled by communicating
  with the donor, however, if they have no relation to what has been uncovered in
  the data, further steps may need to be taken. If the data belong to or are about
  someone living, that person may need to be contacted, depending on the nature of
  the data discovered. If the person of interest is no longer living, legally there
  would no issue disclosing all information uncovered, how- ever, implications for
  living relatives must be considered should the disclosed information be potentially
  revealing or harmful to them. This can include hereditary health issues, political
  or religious views, and other sensitive in- formation. There are significantly more
  variables to con- sider, such as public interest and defamation which can heavily
  impact the decision process following the discovery of sensitive data, all whilst
  guided, but not necessarily enforced by law. This remains somewhat of a gray area
  as the entities handling such data are often exempt from these laws and principles,
  making these decisions ethically and morally based more so than legally. In this
  article, the Australian laws and policies that surround privacy issues, defamation,
  and data relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and culture are
  explored. The aim is to raise awareness on potential issues that may arise in collection
  institutions as well as potential threats already sitting in storage and the laws
  and policies that may serve as guidelines to help overcome/mitigate such issues.
