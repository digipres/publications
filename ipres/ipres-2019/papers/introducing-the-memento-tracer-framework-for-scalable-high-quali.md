abstract: Web archiving at scale and with high-quality is not a trivial endeavor.
  Given the dynamic nature of the web and the increasingly complex features incorporated
  into web pages, sophisticated capturing and archiving approaches are needed. This
  workshop introduces the novel Memento Tracer Framework and invites attendees to
  a hands-on experience with our framework that was designed to track, capture, and
  archive scholarly artifacts. Memento Tracer takes an institutional perspective and
  focuses on artifacts created by or relevant to individual communities. Workshop
  participants will learn about scalable and high-quality web archiving and leave
  with the satisfaction of having actively contributed to saving parts of the (scholarly)
  web.
