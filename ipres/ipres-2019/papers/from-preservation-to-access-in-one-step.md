abstract: 'Access to audiovisual content continues to lag behind that of textual and
  still image content. Its time-based nature means it is tremendously underserved.
  However, current technology makes it possible to create automated transcriptions
  from audio, which can be used to implement granular search tools with high degrees
  of accuracy. This, together with building visualization tools that give the user
  the power to navigate audiovisual content easily, constitutes a unique opportunity
  to enhance access to audiovisual collections.

  Additionally, although some preservation systems offer access platforms, these are
  not designed to display audiovisual content in its full potential. Aviary offers
  specialized access to audiovisual content with granular permissions, and fully searchable
  indexes and transcripts. Generic integrations with preservation systems such as
  Preservica and Archivematica are in being developed currently. This proposal is
  to offer a live demonstration of Aviary focused on integrations with digital preservation
  systems. We expect to be able to provide a demonstration of the system and this
  specific feature at iPRES 2019.'
