abstract: Approaches to digital stewardship vary from institution to institution.
  Given the substantial differences among organizational models and program maturity,
  what indicates successful organization of the long term work of digital preservation
  to practitioners? Panelists will introduce and contextualize their ongoing research
  into the shared characteristics of successful digital preservation programs throughout
  the field. They will identify the emergent themes articulated by research subjects
  thus far and engage attendees to discuss challenges and opportunities of digital
  preservation at their respective institutions.
