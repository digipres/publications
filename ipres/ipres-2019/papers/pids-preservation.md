abstract: 'A persistent identifier (PID) provides a long-lasting reference to an entity.
  PIDs should be open and unique and should resolve to a digital representation of
  the entity. Used in this way, PIDs can serve as an important component in digital
  preservation strategies for academic resources.

  In this panel discussion, representatives from leading PID organizations will explore
  roles that PIDs can play in digital preservation strategies. We invite the participants
  to engage in a conversation on how PID providers can work with the preservation
  community, and what preservation strategies they should be deploying with PID metadata.'
