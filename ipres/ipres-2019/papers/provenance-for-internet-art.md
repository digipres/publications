abstract: When a scholar, curator or archivist is researching an artwork, they need
  provenance, an essential piece of information that can help them evaluate as to
  whether a source can be trusted. This paper will investigate how to express the
  provenance of Internet art as linked data. One of the standards that has emerged
  to describe the provenance of digital data is the W3C PROV. It provides a model
  which facilitates description of the entities, agents and processes involved in
  producing data. This generic model has proven to be applicable in various contexts,
  including the cultural heritage domain [1, 2]. However, its potential to describe
  the provenance of Internet art is not yet fully explored [3]. This paper demonstrates
  how the PROV model can be used to describe the provenance of Internet art by applying
  it to a case study from Rhizomeâ€™s ArtBase, an online archive dedicated to preserving
  works of Internet art. This paper is aimed at digital art conservators, digital
  curators, Web archivists and art historians.
