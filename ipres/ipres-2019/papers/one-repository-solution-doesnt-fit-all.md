abstract: Different digital objects have different preservation requirements involving
  strategies, policies and practices that go beyond the capacity of a single archival
  institution. The variety and complexity of digital objects requires specific knowledge
  for ingesting and the preservation of file formats. Large data files call for a
  different storage set-up than the approach required for the preservation and distribution
  of small objects. Building an organizational and technological infrastructure that
  can cope with the diversity and complexity of digital objects involves an effort
  that far exceeds what a middle-sized institution can do alone. This paper describes
  how the Amsterdam City Archives aims to collaborate with other non-profit institutions
  and partners to improve the quality of the preservation of and access to digital
  objects while reducing costs.
