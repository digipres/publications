abstract: The Wikidata knowledge base provides a public infrastructure for creating
  and syndicating machine-readable data about computing resources. We have prepared
  a set of queries that can be used to gather data sets relevant to digital preservation
  from Wikidata. We present these data sets in the context of the Wikidata for Digital
  Preservation portal (Wikidp). Wikidp is a free software portal that allows people
  to explore data related to digital preservation from the Wikidata knowledge base.
  Structured data about file formats, the many versions of software titles, and computing
  environments, are already available in Wikidata. The content of Wikidata is licensed
  under the Creative Commons Zero license, meaning that anyone can reuse the data
  for any purpose. The content in Wikidata is available in more than 300 human languages.
  The data in Wikidata is FAIR data, and it is linked open data. Our portal provides
  an interface designed for the needs of the digital preservation community.
