abstract: the recovery of digital data from tape formats from the mid to late ’gos
  is not well covered by existing digital preservation and forensics literature. This
  paper addresses this knowledge gap with a discussion of the hardware and software
  that can be used to read such tapes. It introduces tapeimgr, a user-friendly software
  application that allows one to read tapes in a formatagnostic manner. It also presents
  workflows that integrate the discussed hardware and software components. It then
  shows how these workflows were used to recover the contents of a set of DDS-1, DDS-3
  and DLT-IV tapes from the mid to late ’gos. These tapes contain the source data
  of a number of “lost” web sites that the National Library of the Netherlands (KB)
  is planning to reconstruct at a later stage as part of its ongoing Web Archaeology
  project. The paper also presents some first results of sites from 1gg5 that have
  already been reconstructed from these tapes.
