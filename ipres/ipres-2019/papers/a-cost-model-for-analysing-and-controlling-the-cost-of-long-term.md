abstract: For some time now, heritage organisations and other institutions have been
  in agreement about the need for the long-term preservation and accessibility of
  valuable digital resources. What is much less clear, however, is how much this would
  cost. In many cases, not enough consideration is given to the long-term cost of
  curating digital collections, often because very little is actually known about
  this aspect. As a result, such management costs are frequently not included in the
  ordinary operating expenses of the institutions in question. Moreover, many heritage
  institutions tend to assume that the long-term costs are very high, partly due to
  the exponential rise in the volume of material, whether digitised or born-digital.
  In many cases, incidental revenue (i.e. project income) is used to pay for longterm
  management costs. But is this assumption correct? And how can we control the cost
  of curating digital collections in the long term?
