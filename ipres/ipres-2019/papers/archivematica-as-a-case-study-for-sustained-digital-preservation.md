abstract: Archivematica is an open source software platform that incorporates the
  community’s experiences and skills to create a robust digital preservation processing
  system. This paper describes Archivematica as a case study for sustained digital-
  preservation software. This paper briefly covers the software’s history before exploring
  in more detail the components that make Archivematica what it is today, taking in
  some of the benefits and some of the current limitations of the approach. Looking
  to the future these limitations are also discussed, as well as other considerations
  about how the system, and how the software can move forward alongside the entire
  digital preservation community.
