abstract: The E-ARK4ALL1 project released an alpha version of its Common Specification
  for Information Packages (CSIP)2 to be used in the eArchiving Building Block3 for
  review at the end of November 2018. Slightly earlier, the Oxford Common File Layout
  (OCFL)4 initiative had also released an alpha version of its software independent
  preservation file organisation specification. While, at first sight, these would
  appear to attempt to do similar things, they are in fact, largely complementary
  approaches. While the eARK specification aims to define the logical structure and
  content of Open Archival Information Systems (OAIS)5 Information Packages, the OCFL
  describes how to map any logical digital object layout onto a physical file system
  in a preservation-friendly manner, as well as identifying the fundamental operations
  required to manage such objects. This paper provides a brief introduction to the
  two specifications and then describes how the OCFL can be applied to an E-ARK IP.
