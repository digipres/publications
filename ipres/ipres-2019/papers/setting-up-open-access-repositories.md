abstract: Research outputs produced by developing countries lack visibility. Common
  reasons are high costs of publishing, reluctance to share, as well as lack of journals
  focusing on research challenges specific to developing countries. The ongoing change
  towards open access and the rising popularity of institutional repositories allows
  for bridging the gap to developed countries. However, this still requires cultural,
  organizational and technical changes. In this paper, we describe a holistic approach
  for deploying open access repositories and building research data management services
  and increasing data curation skills. We describe how we identified usersâ€™ needs
  and necessary supporting systems and services. We also explain the rationale and
  challenges faced when implementing popular repository systems and share experiences
  in developing institutional data management policies. Finally, we provide common
  goals for a national roadmap. All these actions are the first step towards the preservation
  of both research outputs and cultural assets. The paper is based on our experiences
  from ROMOR project that helped in establishing policies, systems, and organizational
  workflows at four Palestinian universities.
