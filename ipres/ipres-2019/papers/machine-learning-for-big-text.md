abstract: 'Big datasets can be a rich source of history, yet they pose many challenges
  to archivists. They can be difficult to acquire and process due to the varied formats
  and sheer volume of files. Sensitive content must be identified in advance of making
  materials publicly available. These challenges inhibit access for research purposes
  and often dissuade archivists from acquiring big datasets. Predictive coding can
  alleviate these challenges by using supervised machine learning to: augment appraisal
  decisions, identify and prioritize sensitive content for review and redaction, and
  generate descriptive metadata of themes and trends. Following the authorsâ€™ previous
  work processing Capstone email, participants will learn about innovative and effective
  practices to enable digital preservation of large textual datasets at scale. Hands-on
  experience with specific tools is provided.'
