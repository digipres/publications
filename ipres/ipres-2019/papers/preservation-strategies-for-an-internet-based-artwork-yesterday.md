abstract: This paper investigates possible preservation strategies for an internet-based
  artwork and assesses the strategies that best capture the authenticity of the work
  for future iterations. Two different preservation strategies are applied for the
  internet-based artwork TraceNoizer.org from 2001. A third one, a Linux Live CD,
  was carried out by one of the artists. They are compared and evaluated from the
  perspective of the long-term preservation of the workâ€™s most significant properties.
  Compared to software- based artworks, the characteristics of internet- based artworks
  shift the focus of the preservation measures from the stabilization of the software
  to reduction of server maintenance, protection of server and artwork from internet
  threats and reduction of external dependencies. This paper suggests solutions how
  to handle these challenges and discusses its benefits and disadvantages for long-term
  preservation.
