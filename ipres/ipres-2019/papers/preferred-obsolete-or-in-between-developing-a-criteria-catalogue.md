abstract: The born-digital audio-visual (AV) holdings of the German National Library
  of Science and Technology are analyzed regarding the present file formats. The most
  frequent AV file formats are examined in terms of suitability as preservation format
  based on a catalogue of criteria. Furthermore their risk of obsolescence is evaluated
  using view paths. The examined file formats are not preferred as preservation formats,
  but they are not obsolete either.
