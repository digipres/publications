abstract: The National Archives of the United Kingdom has a leadership role for archives
  in England, representing a very broad range of memory institutions, most with limited
  digital capacity. This paper outlines the multi-strand approach underway to build
  capacity across this network of archives. The paper focuses on the aims of different
  intervention approaches and the involvement of the archives community and its stakeholders
  in different elements of delivery. The paper finishes with preliminary analysis
  of impact and known risks of this approach.
