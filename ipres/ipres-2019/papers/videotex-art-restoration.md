abstract: This poster will discuss the technical and conceptual challenges associated
  with achieving an authentic restoration of videotex art, in the context of a project
  currently underway to recover Canadian Telidon videotex artwork from the early 1980s.
  Strengths and weaknesses of various strategies will be discussed, including emulation,
  format migration, software reconstruction, and the use of period hardware. Goals
  of the poster include showcasing the strategies employed to date, and inviting criticism
  and comment from others with relevant experience to share, so as to refine and improve
  our methodology going forward.
