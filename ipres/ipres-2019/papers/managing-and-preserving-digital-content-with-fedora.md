abstract: Fedora is a flexible, extensible, open source repository platform for managing,
  preserving, and providing access to digital content. For the past several years
  the Fedora community has prioritized alignment with linked data best practices and
  modern web standards. We are now shifting our attention back to Fedora’s digital
  preservation roots with a focus on durability and the Oxford Common File Layout
  (OCFL). This tutorial will provide an introduction to the latest version of Fedora
  with a focus on digital preservation functionality and workflows.
