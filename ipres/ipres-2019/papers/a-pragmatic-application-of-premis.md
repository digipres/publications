abstract: A data model is an expression of how a system is intended to be used, and
  a statement of how it should interact with other systems. As part of the development
  of the latest version of Preservica, the underlying data model was significantly
  altered, informed by what went before and by reference to the experiences and best
  practices distilled into the PREMIS Data Dictionary. This paper reports on some
  of the key decisions made in the application of the PREMIS concepts to an extant
  digital preservation system.
