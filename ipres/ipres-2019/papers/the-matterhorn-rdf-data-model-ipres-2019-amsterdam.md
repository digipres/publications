abstract: Matterhorn RDF is a linked data-based model for archival metadata with the
  goal of improving the contextualization of archival records. It covers the three
  standards ISAD(G), ISAAR(CPF) and ISDF, as well as the areas “Preservation Description
  Information” and “Representation Information” of the OAIS information model. For
  the implementation of Matterhorn RDF, classes and properties of existing ontologies
  are used. The formalization of the model is realized with the help of SHACL shapes.
