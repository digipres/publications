abstract: Libraries and archives are motivated to capture and archive scholarly resources
  on the web. However, the dynamic nature of the web in addition to frequent changes
  at the end of scholarly publishing platforms have crawling engineers continuously
  update their archiving framework. In this paper we report on our comparative study
  to investigate how scholarly publishers respond to common HTTP requests that resemble
  typical behavior of both machines such as web crawlers and humans. Our findings
  confirm that the scholarly web responds differently to machine behavior on the one
  hand and human behavior on the other. This work aims to inform crawling engineers
  and archivists tasked to capture the scholarly web of these differences and help
  guide them to use appropriate tools.
