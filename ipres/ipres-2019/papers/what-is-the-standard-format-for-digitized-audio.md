abstract: The best practices for representing analog audio with digital bitstreams
  are relatively clear. Sample the signal with 24 bits of resolution at 96KHz. The
  standards for storing the data are less clear, especially for media with complex
  configurations of faces, regions, and streams. Whether accomplished through metadata
  and/or file format, the strategy chosen to represent the complexity of the original
  media has long-term preservation implications. Best practice guides rarely document
  these edge cases and informal discussions with practitioners have revealed a wide
  range of practices. This paper aims to outline the specific challenges of representing
  complex audio objects after digitization and approaches that have been implemented
  but not widely adopted.
