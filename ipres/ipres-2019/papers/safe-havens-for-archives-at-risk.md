abstract: The main aim of our poster is to raise awareness among the Digital Preservation
  community of the need for, and particular considerations of, (digital) Safe Havens
  For Archives at Risk. The document “Guiding Principles for Safe havens for archives
  at risk” [1], has been recently published and endorsed by the International Council
  of Archives [2]. The authors are involved in continuing work to develop detailed
  commentaries on each of the Guiding Principles. While the guiding principles are
  format neutral, we highlight specific digital considerations that are emerging in
  development of the commentaries.
