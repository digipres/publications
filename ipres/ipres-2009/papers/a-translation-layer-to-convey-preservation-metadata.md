abstract: 'The long term preservation is a responsibility to share with other organizations,
  even adopting different preservation methods and tools. The overcoming of the interoperability
  issues, by means of the achievement of a flawless exchange of digital assets to
  preserve, enables the feasibility of applying distributed digital preservation policies.
  The Archives Ready To AIP Transmission a PREMIS Based Project (ARTAT-PBP) aims to
  experiment with the adoption of a common preservation metadata standard as interchange
  language in a network of cooperating organizations that need to exchange digital
  resources with the mutual objective of preserving them in the long term. '
