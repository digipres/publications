abstract: This paper will provide an overview of developments from the two phases
  of the LIFE (Lifecycle Information for E-Literature) project, LIFE1 and LIFE2, before
  describing the aims and latest progress from the third phase. Emphasis will be placed
  on the various approaches to estimate preservation costs including the use of templates
  to facilitate user interaction with the costing tool. The paper will also explore
  how the results of the Project will help to inform preservation planning and collection
  management decisions with a discussion of scenarios in which the LIFE costing tool
  could be applied. This will be supported by a description of how adopting institutions
  are already utilising LIFE tools and techniques to analyse and refine their existing
  preservation activity as well as to enhance their collection management decision
  making.
