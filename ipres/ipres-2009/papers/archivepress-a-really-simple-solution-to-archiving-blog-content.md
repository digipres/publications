abstract: 'Blog archiving and preservation is not a new challenge. Current solutions
  are commonly based on typical web archiving activities, whereby a crawler is configured
  to harvest a copy of the blog and return the copy to a web archive. Yet this is
  not the only solution, nor is it always the most appropriate. We propose that in
  some cases, an approach building on the functionality provided by web feeds offers
  more potential. This paper describes research to develop such an approach, suitable
  for organisations of varying size and which can be implemented with relatively little
  resource and technical know-how: the ArchivePress project.'
