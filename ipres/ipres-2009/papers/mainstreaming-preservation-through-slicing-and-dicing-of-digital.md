abstract: 'A digital repository can be seen as a combination of services, resources,
  and policies. One of the fundamental design questions for digital repositories is
  how to break down the services and resources: who will have responsibility, where
  they will reside, and how they will interact. There is no single, optimal answer
  to this question. The most appropriate arrangement depends on many factors that
  vary across repository contexts and are very likely to change over time. This paper
  reports on our investigation and testing of various repository "slicing and dicing"
  scenarios, their potential benefits, and implications for implementation, administration,
  and service offerings. Vital considerations for each option (1) efficiencies of
  resource use, (2) management of dependencies across entities, and (3) the repository
  business model most appropriate to the participating organizations. '
