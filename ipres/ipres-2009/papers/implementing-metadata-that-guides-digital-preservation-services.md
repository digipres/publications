abstract: Effective digital preservation depends on a set of preservation services
  that work together to ensure that digital objects can be preserved for the long-term.
  These services need digital preservation metadata, in particular, descriptions of
  the properties that digital objects may have and descriptions of the requirements
  that guide digital preservation services. This paper analyzes how these services
  interact and use this metadata and develops a data dictionary to support them.
