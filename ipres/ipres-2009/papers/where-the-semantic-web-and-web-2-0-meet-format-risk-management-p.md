abstract: The Web is increasingly becoming a platform for linked data. This means
  making connections and adding value to data on the Web. As more data becomes openly
  available and more people are able to use the data, it becomes more powerful. An
  example is file format registries and the evaluation of format risks. Here the requirement
  for information is now greater than the effort that any single institution can put
  into gathering and collating this information. Recognising that more is better,
  the creators of PRONOM, JHOVE, GDFR and others are joining to lead a new initiative,
  the Unified Digital Format Registry. Ahead of this effort a new RDF-based framework
  for structuring and facilitating file format data from multiple sources including
  PRONOM has demonstrated it is able to produce more links, and thus provide more
  answers to digital preservation questions - about format risks, applications, viewers
  and transformations - than the native data alone. This paper will describe this
  registry, P2, and its services, show how it can be used, and provide examples where
  it delivers more answers than the contributing resources.
