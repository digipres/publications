abstract: This paper will describe the tools and infrastructure components which have
  been implemented by the CASPAR project to support repositories in their task of
  long term preservation of digital resources. We address also the capture and preservation
  of digital rights management and evidence of authenticity associated with digital
  objects. Moreover examples of ways to evaluate a variety of preservation strategies
  will be discussed as will examples of integrating the use of these infrastructure
  components and tools into existing repository systems. Examples will be given of
  a rich selection of digital objects which encode information from a variety of disciplines
  including science, cultural heritage and also contemporary  performing arts.
