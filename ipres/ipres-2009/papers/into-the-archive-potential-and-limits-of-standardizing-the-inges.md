abstract: The ingest and its preparation are crucial steps and of strategical importance
  for digital preservation. If we want to move digital preservation into the mainstream
  we have to make them as easy as possible. The aim of the NESTOR guide "Into The
  Archive" is to help streamlining the planning and execution of ingest projects.
  The main challenge for such a guide is to provide help for a broad audience with
  heterogeneous use cases and without detailed background knowledge on the producer
  side. This paper will introduce the guide, present first experiences and discuss
  the challenges.
