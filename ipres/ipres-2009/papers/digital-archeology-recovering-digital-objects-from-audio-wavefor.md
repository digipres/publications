abstract: Specimens of early computer systems stop working every day. One storage
  medium that was popular for home computers in the 1980s was the audio tape. The
  first home computer systems allowed the use of standard cassette players to record
  and replay data. Audio tapes are more durable than old home computers when properly
  stored. Devices playing this medium (i.e. tape recorders) can be found in working
  condition or can be repaired as they are made out of standard components. By re-engineering
  the format of the waveform the data on such media can then be extracted from a digitized
  audio stream. This work presents a case study of extracting data created on an early
  home computer system, the Philips G7400. Results show that with some error correction
  methods parts of the tapes are still readable, even without the original system.
  It also becomes clear, that it is easier to build solutions now when the original
  systems are still available.
