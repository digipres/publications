abstract: nestor, the German network of expertise in digital preservation started
  as a time-limited project in 2003. Besides the establishment of a network of expertise
  with an information platform, working groups, and training opportunities, a central
  goal of the project phase was to prepare a sustainable organization model for the
  network's services. In July 2009, nestor transformed into a sustainable organization
  with 6 of the 7 project partners and 2 additional organizations entering into a
  consortium agreement. The preparation of the sustainable organization was a valuable
  experience for the project partners because vision and mission of the network were
  critically discussed and refined for the future organization. Some more aspects
  were identified that also need further refinement in order to make nestor fit for
  the future. These aspects shall be discussed in the paper.
