abstract: In order better to meet the needs of its diverse University of California
  constituencies, the California Digital Library UC Curation Center is re-envisioning
  its approach to digital curation infrastructure by devolving function into a set
  of granular, independent, but interoperable microservices. Since each of these services
  is small and self-contained, they are more easily developed, deployed, maintained,
  and enhanced; at the same time, complex curation function can emerge from the strategic
  combination of atomistic services. The emergent approach emphasizes the persistence
  of content rather than the systems in which that management occurs, thus the paradigmatic
  archival culture is not unduly coupled to any particular technological context.
  This results in a curation environment that is comprehensive in scope, yet flexible
  with regard to local policies and practices and sustainable despite the inevitability
  of disruptive change in technology and user expectation.
