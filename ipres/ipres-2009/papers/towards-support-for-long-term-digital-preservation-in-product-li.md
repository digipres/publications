abstract: Important legal and economic motivations exist for the design and engineering
  industry to address and integrate digital long-term preservation into product life
  cycle management (PLM). Investigations revealed that it is not sufficient to archive
  only the product design data which is created in early PLM phases, but preservation
  is needed for data that is produced during the entire product lifecycle including
  early and late phases. Data that is relevant for preservation consists of requirements
  analysis documents, design rationale, data that reflects experiences during product
  operation and also metadata like social collaboration context. In addition, also
  the engineering environment itself that contains specific versions of all tools
  and services is a candidate for preservation. This paper takes a closer look at
  engineering preservation use case scenarios as well as PLM characteristics and workflows
  that are relevant for long-term preservation. Resulting requirements for a long-term
  preservation system lead to an OAIS (Open Archival Information System) based system
  architecture and a proposed preservation service interface that respects the needs
  of the engineering industry.
