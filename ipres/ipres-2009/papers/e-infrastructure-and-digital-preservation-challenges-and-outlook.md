abstract: 'Undoubtedly, long-term preservation has raised a great deal of attention
  worldwide, but in a broader perspective the attention is out of proportion compared
  to the number of real operational solutions – not to mention the big picture of
  a comprehensive digital preservation infrastructure. Up to now, the existing digital
  preservation infrastructure mainly consists of a small number of scattered trusted
  long-term archiving data repositories, which have the control of and the responsibility
  for our digital heritage. The ongoing discussion on e-Infrastructure points out
  that we are still lacking reliable structures which support the expected integrated
  digital preservation infrastructure provided jointly by cultural heritage organizations,
  data centers and data producers. The slow development towards a global integrated
  digital preservation infrastructure in combination with adjacent pressing questions
  for the information infrastructure in general has led to an extended strategic discussion
  within the last years in Europe and the US: In studies, position papers and evaluation
  approaches we find elaborated building blocks for a roadmap and definitions for
  a more advanced landscape. With a focus especially on the German situation and on
  existing and ongoing practical experiences, the paper discusses reasons and strategic
  aspects which maybe can illuminate the prohibitive factors for the unassertive progress.'
