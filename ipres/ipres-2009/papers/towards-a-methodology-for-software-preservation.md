abstract: 'Only a small part of the research which has been carried out to date on
  the preservation of digital objects has looked specifically at the preservation
  of software. This is because the preservation of software has been seen as a less
  urgent problem than the preservation of other digital objects, and also the complexity
  of software artifacts makes the problem of preserving them a daunting one. Nevertheless,
  there are good reasons to want to preserve software. In this paper we consider some
  of the motivations behind software preservation, based on an analysis of software
  preservation practice. We then go on to consider what it means to preserve software,
  discussing preservation approaches, and developing a performance model which determines
  how the adequacy of the a software preservation method. Finally we discuss some
  implications for preservation analysis for the case of software artifacts. '
