abstract: 'TIPR, Towards Interoperable Preservation Repositories, is a project funded
  by the Institute of Museum and Library Services to create and test the Repository
  eXchange Package (RXP). The package will make it possible to transfer complex digital
  objects between dissimilar preservation repositories. For reasons of redundancy,
  succession planning and software migration, such repositories must be able to exchange
  copies of archival information packages with each other. Every different repository
  design, however, describes and structures its archival packages differently. Therefore
  each type produces dissemination packages that are rarely understandable or usable
  as submission packages by other repositories. The RXP is an answer to that mismatch.
  Other solutions for transferring packages between repositories focus either on transfers
  between repositories of the same type, such as DSpace-to-DSpace transfers, or on
  processes that translate a specific dissemination format into a specific submission
  package. Rather than build translators between many dissimilar repository types,
  the TIPR project has defined a standards-based package of metadata files that can
  act as an intermediary information package, the RXP, a lingua franca all repositories
  can read and write. In this paper we present the assumptions and principles underlying
  the TIPR concept of repository-to-repository exchange, and proceed to describe three
  aspects of the TIPR project: the RXP format itself; the tests we are conducting
  to prove and improve the use of the RXP; and finally, issues that have arisen in
  the course of the project so far.'
