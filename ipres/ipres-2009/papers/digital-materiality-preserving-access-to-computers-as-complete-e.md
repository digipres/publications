abstract: This paper addresses a particular domain within the sphere of activity that
  is coming to be known as personal digital papers or personal digital archives. We
  are concerned with contemporary writers of belles-lettres (fiction, poetry, and
  drama), and the implications of the shift toward word processing and other forms
  of electronic text production for the future of the cultural record, in particular
  literary scholarship. The urgency of this topic is evidenced by the recent deaths
  of several high-profile authors, including David Foster Wallace and John Updike,
  both of whom are known to have left behind electronic records containing unpublished
  and incomplete work alongside of their more traditional manuscript materials. We
  argue that literary and other creatively-oriented originators offer unique challenges
  for the preservation enterprise, since the complete digital context for individual
  records is often of paramount importance—what Richard Ovenden, in a helpful phrase
  (in conversation) has termed “the digital materiality of digital culture.” We will
  therefore discuss preservation and access scenarios that account for the computer
  as a complete artifact and digital environment, drawing on examples from the born-digital
  materials in literary collections at Emory University, the Harry Ransom Center at
  The University of Texas at Austin, and the University of Maryland.
