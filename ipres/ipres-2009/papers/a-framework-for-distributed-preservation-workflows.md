abstract: The Planets project is developing a service-oriented environment for the
  definition and evaluation of preservation strategies for human- centric data. It
  focuses on the question of logically preserving digital materials, as opposed to
  the physical preservation of content bit-streams. This includes the development
  of preservation tools for the automated characterization, migration, and comparison
  of different types of digital objects as well as the emulation of their original
  runtime environment in order to ensure longtime access and interpretability. The
  Planets integrated environment provides a number of end-user applications that allow
  data curators to execute and scientifically evaluate preservation experiments based
  on composable preservation services. In this paper, we focus on the middleware and
  programming model and show how it can be utilized in order to create complex preservation
  workflows.
