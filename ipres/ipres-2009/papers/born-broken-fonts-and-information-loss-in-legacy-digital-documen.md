abstract: 'For millions of legacy documents, correct rendering depends upon resources
  such as fonts that are not generally embedded within the document structure. Yet
  there is significant risk of information loss due to missing or incorrectly substituted
  fonts. In this paper we use a collection of 230,000 Word documents to assess the
  difficulty of matching font requirements with a database of fonts. We describe the
  identifying information contained in common font formats, font requirements stored
  in Word documents, the API provided by Windows to support font requests by applications,
  the documented substitution algorithms used by Windows when requested fonts are
  not available, and the ways in which support software might be used to control font
  substitution in a preservation environment. '
