abstract: Library and Archives Canada has a wide mandate to preserve and provide access
  to Canadian published heritage, records of national significance, as well as to
  acquire the records created by the Government of Canada, deemed to be of historical
  importance. To address this mandate, Library and Archives Canada has undertaken
  the development of a digital preservation infrastructure covering policy, standards
  and enterprise applications which will serve requirements for ingest, metadata management,
  preservation and access. The purpose of this paper is to focus on the efforts underway
  to engage digital recordkeeping activities in the Government of Canada and to influence
  and align those processes with LAC digital preservation requirements. The LAC strategy
  to implement preservation considerations early in the life cycle of the digital
  record is to establish a mandatory legislative and policy framework for recordkeeping
  in government. This includes a Directive on Recordkeeping, Core Digital Records
  Metadata Standard for archival records, Digital File Format Guidance, as well as
  Web 2.0 and Email Recordkeeping Guidelines. The expected success of these initiatives,
  and collaborative approach should provide a model for other digital heritage creators
  in Canada.
