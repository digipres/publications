abstract: 'The process of setting up a digital preservation repository in compliancy
  with the OAIS model is not only a technical challenge: libraries also need to develop
  and maintain appropriate skills and organizations. Digital activities, including
  digital preservation, are nowadays moving into the mainstream activity of the Library
  and are integrated in its workflows. The Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF)
  has been working on the definition of digital preservation activities since 2003.
  This paper aims at presenting the organizational and human resources challenges
  that have been faced by the library in this context, and those that are still awaiting
  us. The library has been facing these challenges through a variety of actions at
  different levels: organizational changes, training sessions, dedicated working group
  and task forces, analysis of skills and processes, etc. The results of these actions
  provide insights on how a national library is going digital, and what is needed
  to reach this longstanding goal.'
