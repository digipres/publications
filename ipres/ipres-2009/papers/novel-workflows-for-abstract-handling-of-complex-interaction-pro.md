abstract: 'The creation of most digital objects occurs solely in interactive graphical
  user interfaces which were available at the particular time period. Archiving and
  preservation organizations are posed with large amounts of such objects of various
  types. At some point they will need to, if possible, automatically process these
  to make them available to their users or convert them to a valid format. A substantial
  problem in creating an automated process is the availability of suitable tools.
  We are suggesting a new method, which uses an operating system and application independent
  interactive workflow for the migration of digital objects using an emulated environment.
  Success terms for the conception and functionality of emulation environments are
  therefore devised which should be applied to future long-term archiving methods. '
