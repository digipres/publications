abstract: The Danish Ministry of Culture is currently funding a project to set up
  a model for costing preservation of digital materials held by national cultural
  heritage institutions. The overall objective of the project is to provide a basis
  for comparing and estimating future financial requirements for digital preservation
  and to increase cost effectiveness of digital preservation activities. In this study
  we describe an activity based costing methodology for digital preservation based
  on the OAIS Reference Model. In order to estimate the cost of digital migrations
  we have identified cost critical activities by analysing the OAIS Model, and supplemented
  this analysis with findings from other models, literature and own experience. To
  verify the model it has been tested on two sets of data from a normalisation project
  and a migration project at the Danish National Archives. The study found that the
  OAIS model provides a sound overall framework for cost breakdown, but that some
  functions, especially when it comes to performing and evaluating the actual migration,
  need additional detailing in order to cost activities accurately.
