abstract: 'The challenge of digital preservation of scientific data lies in the need
  to preserve not only the dataset itself but also the ability it has to deliver knowledge
  to a future user community. A true scientific research asset allows future users
  to reanalyze the data within new contexts. Thus, in order to carry out meaningful
  preservation we need to ensure that future users are equipped with the necessary
  information to re-use the data. This paper presents an overview of a preservation
  analysis methodology which was developed in response to that need on the CASPAR
  and Digital Curation Centre SCARP projects. We intend to place it in relation to
  other digital preservation practices discussing how they can interact to provide
  archives caring for scientific data sets with the full arsenal of tools and techniques
  necessary to rise to this challenge. '
