abstract: This paper explores the purpose and development of best practice guidelines
  for the use of preservation metadata as detailed in the PREMIS Data Dictionary for
  Preservation Metadata within documents conforming to the Metadata Encoding and Transmission
  Standard (METS). METS is an XML schema that provides a container format integrating
  various forms of metadata with digital objects or links to digital objects. Because
  of the flexibility of METS to serve many different functions within digital systems
  and to support many different metadata structures, integration guidelines will facilitate
  common practices among institutions. There is constant tension between tighter control
  over the METS package to support object exchange versus each implementation's unique
  preservation metadata requirements given the different contexts and implementation
  models among PREMIS implementers. The PREMIS in METS Guidelines serve primarily
  as a standard for submission and dissemination information packages. This paper
  details the issues encountered in using the standards together, and how the METS
  document changes as events pertaining to the lifecycle of digital assets are recorded
  for future preservation purposes. The guidelines have enabled the implementation
  of an exchange format and creation/validation tools based on the PREMIS in METS
  guidelines.
