abstract: This paper describes and explores the concept of perceived preservation
  levels and their implications. Perceived preservation levels are a way to communicate
  preservation policies, options and actions to the various stakeholders in digital
  preservation a digital preservation system is capable and able of. While explicitly
  assigned or stated preservation levels are promises to adhere to a certain set of
  policies and decisions, it may be hard to impossible for a best effort preservation
  service to fulfill these expectations. Perceived preservation levels combine different
  outcomes from preservation actions with preservation options and available resources
  to convey a holistic view of the archive’s worflow and decision states. A preservation
  system providing information about current states of digital objects puts the data
  producers in a position to reassure themselves of the trustworthiness of the archive
  without the need of formal certification. This openness has implications not only
  for the trust relationship between producer and archive but provides the opportunity
  to constantly reassess the archive’s decisions and priorities from the outside.
