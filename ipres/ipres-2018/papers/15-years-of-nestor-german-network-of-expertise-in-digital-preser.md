abstract: nestor is the German network of expertise in Digital Preservation. Like
  iPRES, nestor looks back on a history of 15 years in 2018. On the occasion of the
  15th iPRES conference, this paper will trace back those lines to look into early
  motivations of the nestor founding partners, and into the successes and lessons
  learned while establishing the network. It will give an overview of some recent
  developments and current work in nestor and close with the prospects of the challenges
  ahead.
