abstract: '"In the very broad scope addressed by digital preservation initiatives,
  a special place belongs to the scientific and technical artifacts that we need to
  properly archive to enable scientific reproducibility. For these artifacts we need
  identifiers that are not only unique and persistent, but also support integrity
  in an intrinsic way. They must provide strong guarantees that the object denoted
  by a given identifier will always be the same, without relying on third parties
  and external administrative processes.

  In this article, we report on our quest for this identifiers for digital objects
  (IDOs), whose properties are different from, and complementary to, those of the
  various digital identifiers of objects (DIOs) that are in widespread use today.
  We argue that both kinds of identifiers are needed and present the framework for
  intrinsic persistent identifiers that we have adopted in Software Heritage for preserving
  billions of software artifacts."'
