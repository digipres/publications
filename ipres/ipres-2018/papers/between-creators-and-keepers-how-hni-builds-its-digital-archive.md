abstract: In 2017 Het Nieuwe Instituut (HNI) â€“ Dutch agency for architecture, design
  and digital culture started a research project leading to the implementation of
  a digital archive for its architecture collection at the end of 2018. Looking at
  the changes caused by progressing digitization that over the last decades have affected
  the profession of the architect the institute shapes its approach to collecting
  born-digital material in architecture. The implementation of the digital archive
  with the related policies and workflows will thus stem out from the results of this
  on-going project. What is possible to ensure better preservation of digital material
  by the creators, and what is feasible to preserve and make available to the users
  are crucial questions for HNI. This paper presents the ongoing research and the
  starting process of its translation into the implementation of a digital archive
  at HNI.
