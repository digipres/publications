abstract: The aim of this paper is to illustrate how vulnerable bit preservation is,
  regardless of how well prepared you think you are, and hopefully to inspire other
  institutions that may face similar challenges at some point. At the same time, this
  paper illustrates the importance of research in digital preservation and the need
  for conferences like iPRES to enable communication about relevant practical experiences
  and research results. The paper includes an illustrative story about how parts of
  the Danish digital cultural heritage was rescued after being endangered by accumulating
  political, environmental and organizational events, and where the final solution
  involves outsourcing parts of the bit preservation solution. The story includes
  a description of how the bits were rescued by different means. Firstly, by using
  research results to convince political management that bit preservation is much
  more than a storage solution that can be outsourced. Secondly, by initiating various
  actions to re-establish the wanted level of bit safety. And thirdly, by establishing
  a contractual and procedural basis for outsourcing parts of the bit preservation.
