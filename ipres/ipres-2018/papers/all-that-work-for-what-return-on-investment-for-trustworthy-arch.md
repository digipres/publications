abstract: 'TIB – Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology hosts and operates
  a digital preservation system with three purposes: for the preservation of our own
  holdings, as a system which two other large German libraries – ZB MED and ZBW –
  use as tenants for the preservation of their holdings, and as a platform to offer
  preservation-as-a-service to smaller institutions. The consortial nature of the
  system hosted and operated by TIB is a setup which isn’t explicitly taken into consideration
  by documentation accompanying certification procedures so far. Neither the Data
  Seal of Approval nor the nestor seal foresee a tiered model, where parts of an archival
  system’s responsibility – e.g., the technical infrastructure – fall into the responsibility
  of a system other than the one who actually makes archival decisions about the content
  captured within. Nevertheless, TIB and ZBW separately received the Data Seal of
  Approval in 2015 and the nestor seal in 2017.

  The paper presents and critically reflects upon experiences made by TIB during the
  certification process. It describes the institutional resources which were required
  to accumulate the required documentation and how they are spread across different
  organizational units. The authors present incentives for formal certification and
  discuss if and how these incentives paid off.

  While combinations of organizational, technological and legal factors make for a
  plethora of different archives, leading to no two certification processes being
  the same, the outcome of this paper shall serve as guidance to those thinking about
  or concretely planning to undergo basic, extended or formal certification. It shall
  give an insight into resources required, show where potential problems may exist,
  but also discuss benefits of the process.'
