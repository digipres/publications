abstract: Third-party software dependency is a big threat for digital art- works.
  In this paper, we describe our experiences with artworks such as Remote Control
  by Shane Cooper or net.art generator by Cornelia Sollfrank. ZKM | Center for Art
  and Media initiated differ- ent research projects addressing the controversial issues
  of crack- ing abandoned proprietary software or hacking an API to guaran- tee access
  to its digital art collection. We show that using crowd- sourcing efforts as sustainable
  preservation strategies is a promis- ing approach as well as a trigger for new creative
  processes. ZKM opened its gates to pirates and hacker communities thereby ac- knowledging
  their contribution to digital art preservation.
