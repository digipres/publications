abstract: Significant progress and guidance has been produced in data recovery for
  3.5-inch and 5.25-inch floppy disks, but similar recovery steps for 8-inch floppy
  disks remains less documented, while also requiring more setup and configuration.
  The authors present three use cases centering on different collections of 8-inch
  floppies at the University of Colorado Boulder, the Harry Ransom Center, and an
  independent collection of Datapoint 1800 floppies. Strategies and methods are presented
  for acquiring the necessary hardware, connecting and powering the devices, and preliminary
  steps in data acquisition. The authors describe specific impediments to data recovery
  and present the gaps in producing value out of the raw data acquisition. The authors
  conclude that encoding and format analysis, file extraction and older machine and
  software emulation are all areas for further exploration in the interest of bringing
  older 8-inch floppy media content to researchers.
