abstract: 'The British Library and the other UK Legal Deposit Libraries have been
  collecting various forms of born-digital digital publications since 2013 as part
  of what is known as Non-Print Legal Deposit (NPLD). In 2017, the UK Legal Deposit
  Libraries established an Emerging Formats project to look at selected types of content
  that were potentially in scope for NPLD. At the beginning of 2018, the British Library’s
  digital preservation team commenced research, as part of the project, into the preservation
  implications of some of these new forms of publication. Over the course of three
  months, the project analysed a small sample of interactive narrative works and mobile
  eBook apps from the Apple store. The evaluation revealed specific characteristics
  including: the automated personalization of narrative content; the integration of
  images taken by device cameras; movement-driven behavioural changes to item displays;
  the use of third party content to drive narratives forward; and, game-like features
  with a high dependency on visual, illustrated displays. Engagement with content
  experts underlined the significance of the interactive elements, suggesting that
  any subsequent preservation plans need to take this into account. Accompanying technical
  analysis using the Library’s format sustainability assessment framework identified
  issues around DRM (digital rights management), proprietary environments, and the
  use of third-party content. Whilst further research is clearly needed to validate
  the findings beyond the initial sample size and to resolve the technical challenges
  identified, other more conceptual questions remain about such matters as ownership,
  authority, provenance, versioning, and personalization. Engagement with content
  providers will be key to resolving all of these in a satisfactory manner.'
