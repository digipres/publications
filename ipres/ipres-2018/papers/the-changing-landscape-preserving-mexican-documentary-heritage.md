abstract: 'This paper provides insights into the Biblioteca Nacional de Mexico (National
  Library of Mexico)’s  efforts to ensure proper stewardship over its digitized and
  born-digital cultural collections. Since its establishment in 1867, the National
  Library of Mexico has collected unique and invaluable collections that are at the
  heart of Mexico''s Bibliographic Heritage. It became the national Legal Deposit
  library in 1936, giving it the responsibility to create and care for the country’s
  documentary heritage. The Legal Deposit Decree was amended in 1991 in order to include
  electronic documents. In order to provide greater access to its collections, two
  main digital platforms were created: the Digital National Newspaper Library and
  the Digital National Library. This paper outlines the challenges the National Library
  of Mexico faces in order to preserve and provide long-term access to digital cultural
  collections and strategies that have been implemented so far. It shows how these
  impact on old rooted practices and how the library is planning to move forward in
  establishing sustainable approaches to guarantee the digital preservation of Mexico''s
  documentary heritage.'
