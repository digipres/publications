abstract: 'The Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL) initiative is an effort to define
  a shared approach to file hierarchy for long-term preservation. What began as a
  discussion at the Fedora and Samvera Camp held in Oxford, UK in September of 2017
  has grown into a focused community effort. Many repository systems store large amounts
  of data that are difficult to migrate, and such migrations risk data loss. Within
  a storage system, digital objects should be designed under the assumption that they
  will be accessed and managed by a variety of applications. This effort is an attempt
  to decouple the structure of the persisted files from the software that might manage
  it by creating an expectation of file hierarchy to which software applications must
  conform, whether implemented in a conventional filesystem with files and directories,
  or in an object store. Thus the file hierarchy functions as a storage Application
  Programming Interface (API). This effort addresses three primary requirements: 1)
  completeness, so that a repository can be rebuilt from the files, 2) parsability,
  both by humans and machines in the absence of original software, and 3) robustness
  against errors, corruption and migration between storage technologies. This paper
  describes motivations, principles and anticipated features of the proposed file
  layout. The OCFL initiative aims to produce draft specifications for trial use by
  Fall 2018.'
