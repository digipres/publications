abstract: 'Email provides a rich history of an organization yet poses unique challenges
  to archivists. It is difficult to acquire and process due to sensitive content and
  diverse topics and formats, which inhibits access and research. Predictive coding
  alleviates these challenges by using supervised machine learning to: augment appraisal
  decisions, identify and prioritize sensitive content for review and redaction, and
  generate descriptive metadata of themes and trends. Following the authorsâ€™ previous
  work which describes the project at its inception, preliminary findings support
  the use of predictive coding as an effective tool to enable digital preservation
  at scale. Specific tools, methodologies, and human factors that affect their success
  are discussed.'
