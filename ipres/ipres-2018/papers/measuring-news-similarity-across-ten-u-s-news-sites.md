abstract: News websites make editorial decisions about what stories to in- clude on
  their website homepages and what stories to emphasize (e.g., large font size for
  main story). The emphasized stories on a news website are often highly similar to
  many other news websites (e.g, a terrorist event story). The selective emphasis
  of a top news story and the similarity of news across different news organizations
  are well-known phenomena but not well-measured. We provide a method for identifying
  the top news story for a select set of U.S.- based news websites and then quantify
  the similarity across them. To achieve this, we first developed a headline and link
  extractor that parses select websites, and then examined ten United States based
  news website homepages during a three month period, No- vember 2016 to January 2017.
  Using archived copies, retrieved from the Internet Archive (IA), we discuss the
  methods and difficulties for parsing these websites, and how events such as a presidential
  election can lead news websites to alter their document representa- tion just for
  these events. We use our parser to extract k = 1, 3, 10 maximum number of stories
  for each news site. Second, we used the cosine similarity measure to calculate news
  similarity at 8PM Eastern Time for each day in the three months. The similarity
  scores show a buildup (0.335) before Election Day, with a declining value (0.328)
  on Election Day, and an increase (0.354) after Election Day. Our method shows that
  we can effectively identity top stories and quantify news similarity.
