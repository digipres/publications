abstract: 'Inspired by the “Knowledge Base” definition of the Open Archival Information
  System: “A set of information, incorporated by a per- son or system, that allows
  that person or system to understand received information”, we developed a mapping
  model for a) cap- turing the knowledge base of the digital preservation metadata,
  represented by the PREMIS Data Dictionary, and b) generating a SKOS vocabulary,
  that represents the PREMIS Knowledge Base. The article proposes, the PREMIS Knowledge
  Base as a knowledge tool, targeted to the digital preservation community, that can
  be used for learning, using, and updating preservation metadata. The tool bridges
  the knowledge expressed by the PREMIS OWL ontology with its knowledge context, stored
  in a “computable form”, and obtained by a semi-automatic transformation mapping
  from the PREMIS Data Dictionary. PREMIS Knowledge Base, as a documen- tation tool,
  provides designated community with web resources for human consultation, and as
  a computable knowledge tool, pro- vides RDF resources exhibited for software agent
  consumption. The PREMIS Knowledge Base candidates itself to be integrated into the
  PREMIS OWL ontology, via annotation property, allowing ontology and related datasets
  to be enriched and documentend by their originationg knowledge context, and thus
  to be properly interpreted.'
