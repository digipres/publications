abstract: '"Digital preservation practitioners are often asked to make collec- tion
  and preservation decisions about content they steward; more often than not this
  is simply because a collection contains or is solely composed of digital content.
  However, traditional preserva- tion practitioners typically do not make these same
  decisions in a vacuum for analog collections; they are informed and prioritized
  by selectors, liaisons, or curators who make decisions based on con- tent and collection
  priorities in concert with information provided by the preservation practitioners.
  In this paper, we argue that this model should not change sim- ply because the nature
  of the materials has changed. While digital preservation may be new to an institution,
  basic preservation de- cisions are best prioritized by the people building collections
  and selecting content, which is complemented by the knowledge and expertise from
  digital preservation practitioners. Selectors and curators are collaborative preservation
  partners whose roles and expertise render them best able to judge the value of the
  content they collect. Digital preservation practitioners have an obligation to work
  with selectors and curators to help them understand the ways in which technical
  characteristics, descriptive records, and financial impact, along with value, affect
  selection choices for digital content and how these choices affect a digital preservation
  program. Digital preservation practitioners need to provide selectors and curators
  with guidelines and criteria to help them make informed selection decisions for
  digital content.

  In this paper, we will address this issue in five parts. First, we review existing
  literature and workflows on the issue of selection for general collections. Second,
  we review existing literature on the topic of appraisal in special collections.
  Third, we provide an analysis of how these practices compare and contrast. Fourth,
  we discuss differences between preserving analog and digital content. Finally, we
  recommend specific guidelines and criteria geared to- ward selectors and curators
  to aid with content selection for digital preservation in both general and special
  collections."'
