abstract: '"In January 2015, GPO initiated a project to assess FDsys/govinfo against
  the ISO 16363 Trustworthy Digital Repository standard. As part of the assessment,
  GPO gathered evidence, documented procedures and policies, and confirmed adherence
  to best practices for digital preservation and sustainability for FDsys/govinfo.
  GPO became a participant in the National Digital Stewardship Residency program sponsored
  by Library of Congress and IMLS to perform an internal audit of FDsys/govinfo and
  explore the viability of securing certification under the ISO 16363 standard after
  an ISO 16919 accredited certification body became available.

  With the relative youth of the ISO 16919 standard, there have been many uncertainties
  across the digital preservation community about the viability of ISO 16363 certification
  processes, the availability of auditors, and even the objective value of obtaining
  such certification under the ISO standard. GPO has embraced a necessary artfulness
  in preparing for such a recently developed audit process. As the first Federal institution
  to purse ISO certification, GPO has encountered the challenges of the ambiguity
  surrounding ISO certification with innovative strategies to both stay entirely objective
  about its practices, and meet the highly intricate needs across the spectrum of
  its Designated Communities. In this manner, preparing for an ISO 16363 certification,
  an objective, formal process of evaluation, theoretically should not require an
  interpretive process; however, we will present a realistic overview of how thinking
  creatively while working closely with a standard can produce authoritative and trustworthy
  practices in order to define and meet the needs of the repositoryâ€™s Designated Community."'
