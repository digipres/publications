abstract: The PREMIS 3.0 Ontology Working Group recognized the need for the preservation
  community to be able to use Semantic Web tech- nology to leverage systems managing
  the long-term preservation of digital holdings. Driven by the main principle of
  adherence to the PREMIS Data Dictionary, and a set of well-established Linked Data
  principles, the draft release of the PREMIS 3 OWL ontology comes after two years
  of conceptualization, discussion and experi- mentation. The release of the draft
  was followed by a public review of the revised ontology soliciting a wider discussion
  about the con- ceptual choices expressed by the ontology. This article explains
  how interoperability issues have been addressed, with the intent of maintaining
  continuity between the PREMIS Data Dictionary and the PREMIS OWL ontology.
