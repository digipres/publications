abstract: News, paradigm-shifting ideas, social movements, scientific discoveries
  and artistic creations have all been documented through audiovisual recordings.
  These recordings have, more than any other medium, created social memory, documented
  contemporary history and now form part of our Intangible Cultural Heritage. The
  only way to guarantee the permanence of content recorded on analogue audio-visual
  media is to digitize it (Bradley, 2006). For this reason, the race against time
  to digitize the largest number of recordings possible began around the end of the
  last century. The purpose is combating their technological obsolescence and material
  degradation as well as offering better access to these materials.
