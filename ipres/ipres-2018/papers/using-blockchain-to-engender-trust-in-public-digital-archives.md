abstract: '"Archives are special – the homes of our collective memories. Although
  the archive is still widely perceived as a trusted custodian, archivists are aware
  that they are working in a world in which digital content is increasingly questioned.
  Is the archive trusted because of its people and practices or because of the sheer
  practical impossibility of altering or manipulating kilometres of physical records?
  What is the digital equivalent? The emerging challenge around trust is particularly
  relevant in relation to public archives preserving records of contentious histories;
  terms such as “fake news” and “post-truth” are frequently heard in the context of
  national and international politics. How do we ensure that researchers continue
  to trust that the records have not been tampered with, or that a document can be
  verified as being the same as the archived original?

  The ARCHANGEL project is breaking new ground by using blockchain to record checksums
  and other metadata derived from either scanned physical or born-digital records
  to allow verification of their integrity over decade- or century- long timespans.
  This data is permanently preserved through peer-to-peer distribution and consensus
  checking without the need for a trusted third party."'
