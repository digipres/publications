abstract: '"With the introduction of tools like the DLF’s Digitization Cost Cal- culator,
  forecasting and fundraising for digitization projects can be achieved with transparency
  and clarity. However, estimating and articulating the considerable long-term expenses
  of digital preser- vation lags behind. The surfeit of digital materials entering
  cultural heritage institutions introduce significant costs that rapidly outstrip
  the costs of digitization, and these costs are challenging to represent clearly
  at the outset of a project–either due to obscure technical details, the array of
  pricing options for storage and preservation systems, and the impossibility of predicting
  the price of ""keeping it forever.""

  In our library, we are in the early stages of developing a cost model for digital
  preservation systems loosely aligned to the costs of systems and activities within
  the NDSA Levels of Digital Preser- vation framework. This work is intended to articulate
  the ongoing costs of desirable and essential digital curation activities to digital
  project stakeholders, as well as administrators–with the ultimate goal of sustainable
  funding for responsible digital preservation. Our ""Digital Preservation Cost Calculator""
  has been successfully used to estimate project expenditures in preparation for grant
  applications and philanthropic financing requests.

  We are exploring prospective features that can transition this tool from a local
  budgeting tool to a full-fledged digital preservation application. This paper will
  introduce our use case and require- ments, current development challenges, and propose
  a prospective roadmap and options for community engagement."'
