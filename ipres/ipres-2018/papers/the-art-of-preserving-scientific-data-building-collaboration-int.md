abstract: Scientists collect, generate, and analyze data in a variety of forms. Oftentimes,
  this leads to datasets that have been organized, rendered, and stored by and in
  different methods, software, and storage locations. Databases are one means by which
  to organize and retrieve data. The complexity of databases as digital objects presents
  practical challenges for archivists, data curators, and digital preservationists.
  In this paper we discuss a collaborative project to assess and develop strategies
  for preserving and creating access for a scientific database from the veterinary
  medicine domain that leverages archival, digital preservation, and data curation
  expertise and resources.
