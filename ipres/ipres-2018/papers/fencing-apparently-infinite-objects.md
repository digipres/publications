abstract: 'Todays digital preservation practice focuses mostly on fixed or complete
  objects, which are defined by their manifestation as files or records with the assumption
  that if one has the file(s) at hand, the preservation or curational effort can be
  focused on the local content only. With increasing importance of networked objects
  or software, object boundaries appear increasingly “blurry”: for instance, many
  software applications are staged to look and be- have like locally running binaries,
  when in fact an orchestration of networked processes is required for their operation.
  To cope with apparently infinite objects and their increasing complexity, this paper
  explores an expanded definition of object boundaries for performative objects.'
