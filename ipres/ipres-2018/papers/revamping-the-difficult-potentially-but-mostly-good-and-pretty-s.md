abstract: 'Archivists at the University of Michigan Bentley Historical Library recently
  concluded a project to review and initiate improvements to our five-year-old workflow
  for transferring born-digital archival materials from removable media to a more
  suitable preservation environment. This “revamp” proceeded in three phases: 1) a
  review of our current capture and transfer to backlog procedures, which included
  the process of gathering feedback on the workflow and associated documentation from
  Bentley archivists; 2) researching contemporary archives and digital preservation
  theory and best practices and conducting information-gathering interviews with colleagues
  at peer institutions; and 3) making a number of recommendations for improvement
  now being implemented by the project team. After briefly outlining our institutional
  context and providing an overview of our work with removable media, this short paper
  will give an overview of the “Removable Media Workflow Revamp” project as well as
  the ways our “agile” approach to the process permitted us to evolve in response
  to early feedback and ultimately adapt our recommendations to better align with
  archivists’ needs.'
