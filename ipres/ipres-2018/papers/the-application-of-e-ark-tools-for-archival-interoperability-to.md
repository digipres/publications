abstract: Since the early 2000s the European Union has promoted and supported the
  development of cross-border and digital means for conducting business and running
  governments. This strategic focus, carried out through the initial Lisbon Strategy1
  and the follow-up Europe 2020 strategy2 has contributed to a widespread shift toward
  e-governments and e-commerce. Ultimately, this has transformed the relationships
  between governments, citizens and business. From a technical perspective, a wide
  range of new information systems and communication methods have become available
  that streamline and automate transactions, enable integration of information and
  service delivery, and enhance collaboration between participants. It has also changed
  the ways of conducting public and private business, documenting activities, and
  making information available for reuse, aiding decision-making and supporting accountability.
  Much of this information has to remain available for long periods, often beyond
  the life expectancy of individual information systems or technological components.
  This poses a significant challenge for both the original data creators and digital
  archives that have to be capable of both dealing with the most current information
  technology, and with “saving” information from a variety of legacy systems. In order
  to deal with these challenges there is a need to bridge the gap between the methods
  used in digital preservation and content creation and introduce additional practical
  interoperability into the solutions used for a Digital Single Market and digital
  preservation infrastructures. The European Commission recognised the need in 2013
  and funded the E-ARK project3 (2014 – 2017) which successfully delivered a set of
  principles, specifications and tools that provided an interoperable and international
  solution for the sustainable long-term availability of digital information. This
  paper describes the solutions first developed during the E-ARK project, focusing
  on the SIP format, as well as the steps the European Commission is taking towards
  building a thriving digital preservation community around the E-ARK outcomes.
