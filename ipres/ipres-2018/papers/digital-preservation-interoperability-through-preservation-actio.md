abstract: Current digital preservation systems such as Archivematica and Preservica
  lack a common and consistent way to describe and execute preservation policies and
  actions at a technical level. Archivematica’s Format Policy Register (FPR) and Preservica’s
  Linked Data Registry (LDR) both define what tools and rules to use when doing digital
  preservation and whilst these two approaches aim to solve similar problems, they
  are not interoperable. There is no way to share technical information between the
  two solutions and for users to share their experience on what approaches to use
  in different contexts and why. This hinders implementation and execution of digital
  preservation in an interoperable way within the digital preservation community.
  This paper presents new work by Artefactual, Arkivum, Preservica and Jisc on how
  Preservation Action Registries (PAR) could be used to capture and share technical
  best practice for the preservation of digital objects in the form of a corpus of
  machine-readable recommendations. The registry’s data model defines what tools can
  be used for different digital object formats, what properties can be extracted or
  measured and what preservation actions can be taken. The model includes contextual
  and historical information on the reasons why recommendations are being given. The
  information is versioned and includes the tool parameters and software environments
  needed to execute different preservation actions so they are directly ‘executable’
  by preservation systems. Our model makes registry content accessible through APIs
  using a distributed set of registries rather than a single canonical source. In
  this way, information can be made available from a range of sources including central
  registries (moderated and curated) or by exchange directly between trusted peer
  institutions or systems. Preservation systems such as Archivematica and Preservica
  are able to publish to and consume content from these registries. The work is supported
  by Jisc as part of the Research Data Shared Service initiative and we believe is
  the first time that vendors, national service providers and end-users have all come
  together in this way. The PAR approach should engender greater confidence in digital
  preservation, provide users with more flexibility and knowledge sharing opportunities,
  and accelerate the adoption of digital preservation in new sectors.
