abstract: "Web archives, a key area of digital preservation, meet the needs of journalists,
  social scientists, historians, and government orga- nizations. The use cases for
  these groups often require that they guide the archiving process themselves, selecting
  their own original resources, or seeds, and creating their own web archive collections.
  We focus on the collections within Archive-It, a subscription service started by
  the Internet Archive in 2005 for the purpose of allowing organizations to create
  their own collections of archived web pages, or mementos. Understanding these collections
  could be done via their user-supplied metadata or via text analysis, but the metadata
  is applied inconsistently between collections and some Archive-It collections consist
  of hundreds of thousands of seeds, making it costly in terms of time to download
  each memento. Our work pro- poses using structural metadata as an additional way
  to understand these collections. We explore structural features currently existing
  in these collections that can unveil curation and crawling behaviors. We adapt the
  concept of the collection growth curve for understand- ing Archive-It collection
  curation and crawling behavior. Using the growth curves, we can see if most of the
  mementos in the collection are skewed earlier or later. We also introduce several
  seed features to describe the diversity and types of seeds present in an Archive-It
  collection. With these seed features, we come to an understanding of the diversity
  of resources that make up a collection and the depth of those resources within their
  seed websites, indicating whether the curator chose to preserve the top-level page
  or something more specific within a site. Finally, we use the descriptions of each
  collec- tion to identify four semantic categories of Archive-It collections. Using
  the identified structural features, we reviewed the results of runs with 20 classifiers
  and are able to predict the semantic category of a collection using a Random Forest
  classifier with a weighted average F1 score of 0.720, thus bridging the structural
  to the de- scriptive. Our method is useful because it saves the researcher time
  and bandwidth. They do not need to download every resource in the collection in
  order to identify its semantic category. Identifying collections by their semantic
  category allows further downstream processing to be tailored to these categories.\tWeb
