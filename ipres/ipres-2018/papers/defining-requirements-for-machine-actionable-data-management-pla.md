abstract: "\"Data Management Plans (DMPs) are free-form text documents describing
  data used and produced in research projects. The workload and bureaucracy often
  associated with tradi- tional DMPs can be reduced when they become machine- actionable.
  However, there is no common definition of what machine-actionable DMPs really are.
  This hinders the com- munication between stakeholders and leads to scepticism, or
  conversely to exaggerated expectations. This paper aims to clarify what machine-actionable
  DMPs are and provides examples of how involved stakeholders can benefit from them.
  It describes an open stakeholder con- sultation performed by the RDA DMP Common
  Standards working group. The main objective was to define the scope of information
  covered by machine-actionable DMPs and formulate an initial set of requirements
  for a common data model for machine actionable DMPs. To do this we used methodology
  known from system and software requirements engineering to collect information on
  how needs for infor- mation of particular stakeholders evolve over phases of the
  research data lifecycle.\tData Management Plans (DMPs) are free-form text documents
