abstract: Recent years have been marked by growing adoption of Archival Resource Key
  (ARK) identifiers in France and in French-speaking countries, growing reliance on
  National Library of France (BnF) ARKs for data dissemination and growing demand
  for data permanence from the BnF community – the French libraries. The BnF has acknowledged
  these changes through renewed efforts in education, communication, and development
  of good practices. This progress report describes the recent upsurge of interest
  in ARKs, the main difficulties posed by identifier management for the BnF and its
  community, and finally “ARK Summit 2018”, a major event in the construction of a
  francophone community of interest around ARK identifiers.
