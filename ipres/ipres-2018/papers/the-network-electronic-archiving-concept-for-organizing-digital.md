abstract: 'This paper presents details about a network organization that enables small
  public archives in Denmark to do professional digital preservation that both lives
  up to established best practices and is economically feasible. The Network Electronic
  Archiving (NEA) is built around extensive collaboration and sharing with archival
  infrastructure and expert staff at its core. To demonstrate how NEA works in practice,
  this paper includes the case of one of the small public archives that implement
  NEA support and services into their day-to-day work. From the point of view of a
  small archive this case illustrates how sharing and collaboration via NEA has allowed
  them to do full-scale digital preservation in accordance with OAIS. '
