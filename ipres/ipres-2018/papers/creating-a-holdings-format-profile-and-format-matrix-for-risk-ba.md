abstract: "\"One of the greatest challenge for any archive is the multiplicity of
  file formats, some of which may be decades old. For the United States National Archives
  and Records Administration (NARA), with several decades of history accessioning
  and managing electronic records, this is compounded. NARA required a methodology
  to analyze and visualize what it has in its holdings in order to understand risk,
  and elected to undertake a file format profile and risk analysis of its born-digital
  electronic records. This paper will review the process for the creation of an electronic
  record holdings format profile and the identification of risk assumptions that lead
  to the development of a format risk analysis and preservation prioritization instrument.\tOne
