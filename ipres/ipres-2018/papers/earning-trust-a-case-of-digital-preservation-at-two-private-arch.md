abstract: In this paper a comparison is made between two private Dutch archives (Het
  Nieuwe Instituut and International Institute of Social History) and how they collect
  and preserve born digital collections. In dealing with archival donors, preservation
  policies and IT implementations they have as much in common as they differ from
  each other. For instance, gaining the trust of the archival donors in the archival
  policies of the institute is a top priority for both organizations. Nonetheless,
  how precisely that trust is shaped is entirely dependent on the type of archives
  being collected, the context in which the institutes have to operate and the collection
  and preservation policies of either institute. This paper gives insight in these
  differences and similarities with the aim to find the areas where the organizations
  might truly support each other.
