abstract: Photogrammetry – taking overlapping photographs of an object and converting
  them into 3D digital models – is increasingly popular as a technique for recording,

  explores steps taken at the University of St Andrews Libraries and Museums to preserve
  the outputs of our photogrammetry activity, including research in to emerging good
  practice, lessons learned, and potential future steps.
