abstract: As digital preservation practice has matured, our understanding of what
  is covered by the Rights landscape broadened significantly. However, the Rights
  entity in the PREMIS data model has not kept pace with these changes, undergoing
  only minor revisions. In 2019, the PREMIS Editorial Committee formed a working group
  on Rights to review how the entity could be changed to better reflect the evolving
  use cases of our community. The initial phase of this work has involved gathering
  use cases in order to perform a gap analysis with the current definition of Rights
  within the PREMIS model. Ahead of an official White Paper describing the scope of
  the revisions to be considered, this paper presents a discussion of the use cases
  that have informed this work, and the gaps we have identified, before briefly outlining
  the next steps to be taken.
