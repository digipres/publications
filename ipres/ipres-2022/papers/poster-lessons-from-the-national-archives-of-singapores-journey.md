abstract: This poster presents a case study of the ongoing development of a digital
  preservation system for public records at the National Archives of Singapore (NAS).
  It describes some challenges faced and lessons learnt, applying the conceit, “If
  I could travel back in time and speak to myself shortly after I joined this project,
  what would I say?”
