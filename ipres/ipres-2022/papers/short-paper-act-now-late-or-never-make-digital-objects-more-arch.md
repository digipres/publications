abstract: Newly acquired or published objects might be corrupt or might not conform
  to the archiveâ€™s best practices. In some cases the library or archive even has to
  ask the data provider for replacements. The advantage of a pre-archival workflow
  to detect or prevent problems early in institutional data processing is depicted
  in this paper.
