abstract: In 2021, the Carmichael Watson project website — a highly valued resource
  of Gaelic culture, culminating in an investment of over £750,000 — faced imminent
  termination. This case study details how this project website, only online from
  2013 until 2018, came to imminent risk of permanent loss. It then presents the strategy
  undertaken to transform it into a more sustainable format through web archiving
  and to revive its public accessibility.
