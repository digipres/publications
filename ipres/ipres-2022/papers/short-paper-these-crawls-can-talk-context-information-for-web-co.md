abstract: 'The National Library of the Netherlands has been harvesting the web since
  2007. As is well known, an archived website is fundamentally different from a website
  on the live web. As a digital repository we create archival objects in the process
  of archiving, especially in the case of web harvesting since a website does not
  have clear boundaries. This means we define the limits ourselves. So how do we provide
  researchers with information on the choices we made during the process of selection,
  harvesting and ingest? How can we prove the integrity and authenticity of our web
  collections to our designated community? Based on the findings of Maemura et al.
  in 2018, three categories of information should be available for researchers of
  web collections: scope elements, process elements and context elements. This will
  help researchers understand what is present in a collection, what curatorial decisions
  have been made in the process and the reason behind the creation of the collection.
  In this article we will describe three documentation initiatives related to our
  web collections that we think could be seen as implementations of these three types
  of documentation elements.'
