abstract: There is a wealth of academic information accumulated on social media, which
  has not been discussed in long-term conservation practices and research at home
  and abroad. In order to provide forethought for the future development of long-term
  preservation, this paper attempts to discuss how to evaluate the long-term preservation
  value of academic information on social media. Based on the analysis of the characteristics
  and preservation value of academic information on social media, this paper proposes
  a long-term preservation value evaluation index system based on meta-synthesis method.
  The next step is to invite experts to make judgments and propose amendments to this
  evaluation index system.
