abstract: 'This workshop revisits the iPres 2019 workshop on complex digital objects
  to address the opportunities and challenges generated by works created using novel
  or non-standard technologies. Collection management solutions for such objects are
  becoming an increasing need for museums, libraries, and archives. At the 2019 workshop,
  participants indicated they currently have complex objects in their care without
  a solution for preserving them. This updated workshop will draw on sector-wide progress
  as well as innovations catalyzed by rapid collecting initiatives to document the
  COVID pandemic. Preserving Complex Digital Objects - Revisited will again create
  an opportunity for digital preservation professionals to share insights and experiences
  and forge new paths forward together. '
