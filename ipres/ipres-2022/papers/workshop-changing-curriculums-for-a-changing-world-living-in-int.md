abstract: 'As we live through the significant challenges of pandemic, information
  wars, climate change, and war in Europe, what skills do current students and future
  practitioners need to cope with managing digital materials in our historical moment?
  What might a holistic syllabus encompassing DP skills, knowledge, and personal qualities
  alongside awareness of social and political trends, and an understanding of the
  interplay between the two, look like in a Higher Education context? This workshop
  aims to discuss and disrupt the ideas around Digital Curation (DC) and Digital Preservation
  (DP) education for future professionals and those managing digital collections.
  It will bring together stakeholders drawn from the those delivering DP education,
  those learning, employers, and practitioners, to interrogate and reflect on the
  suitability of existing curricula in Higher Education (HE) for a changing world.  '
