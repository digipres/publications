  as basis for bit preservation of Danish cultural heritage for the past ten years.  This
  poster will present the capabilities of the BitRepository.org framework with respect
  to how it can support advanced bit preservation on changing software and media technologies.
  The Bitrepository.org framework enables use of storage of copies on all types of
  current and future media, it supports daily bit preservation operations, it enables
  setup with high access possibilities as well as providing a basis for high operation
  security at all levels. The poster will also present experience with the use of
  the BitRepository.org as well as how the Royal Danish Library uses it for different
  levels of bit safety, confidentiality, access and costs.
