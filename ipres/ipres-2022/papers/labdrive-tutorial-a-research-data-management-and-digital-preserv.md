abstract: Jisc and the Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC) have undertaken an anonymous
  surveying exercise in order to unearth the true cost of catastrophic data lossâ€”not
  only in terms of the value of the data, but also the cost of the knock-on effects
  that may only become apparent some considerable time after the event. This information
  can be used to help organisations make a stronger case for robust and effective
  digital preservation practice and to inform those trying to take steps to avoid
  their own data loss disaster. This workshop, intended to bring together those who
  have lost data with those who wish to avoid losses, explores the usefulness of such
  data loss events to the community.
