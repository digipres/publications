abstract: This panel discussion will report on a recent data-driven project to map
  the current landscape for digital preservation of open access books. While it has
  been possible to understand the degree to which open access journals are at risk
  due to gaps in digital preservation provisions, OA books are more fragmented due
  to the lack of comprehensive international services for discovery or on which to
  build a registry of preservation providers and their holdings.
