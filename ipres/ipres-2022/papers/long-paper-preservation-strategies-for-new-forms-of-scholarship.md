abstract: The advance in technologies for publishing digital scholarship has outpaced
  the development of technologies for reliably preserving it. Authors and publishers
  are creating increasingly sophisticated products without realizing that some of
  their enhancement choices might put preservability--and valuable scholarship--at
  risk.  In a project funded by Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and led by NYU Libraries,
  a group of digital preservation institutions, libraries, and university presses
  collaborated to study examples of these dynamic forms of scholarship to determine
  they could be preserved in their current form and whether it would be possible to
  do this at scale.  This paper will provide a summary of this project and key themes
  that could impact preservation of enhanced scholarly works.
