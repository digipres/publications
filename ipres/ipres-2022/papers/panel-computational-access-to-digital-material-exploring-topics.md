abstract: Computational access is a newly emerging approach to access within the digital
  preservation community. This type of access is becoming more widely discussed, but
  a lot of uncertainties are present around the term. A guide is being created as
  part of a collaborative piece of work between the Digital Preservation Coalition
  (DPC) and Leontien Talboom, Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) fellow 2021
  to help digital preservation practitioners to understand the topic and take some
  practical steps towards implementation. The creation of this guide is leading to
  much wider discussions on this topic, many of which will not find their way into
  the guide in much detail. This panel session will therefore provide an opportunity
  and platform to discuss these issues in greater depth with a range of practitioners
  with practical experience in this area.
