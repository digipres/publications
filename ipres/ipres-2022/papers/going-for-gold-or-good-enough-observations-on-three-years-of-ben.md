abstract: The Digital Preservation Coalition’s Rapid Assessment (DPC RAM) was launched
  at the iPres conference in 2019. This digital preservation maturity model was developed
  with community input as part of a collaborative project with the UK Nuclear Decommissioning
  Authority. The DPC’s hope was that it would be of broad utility to the wider digital
  preservation community, providing a flexible framework for assessing current capabilities
  and future goals. This short paper reflects on the three years since the publication
  of DPC RAM, discussing progress that has been made and lessons that have been learned
  since it was first launched. Future directions for the maturity model are also articulated.
