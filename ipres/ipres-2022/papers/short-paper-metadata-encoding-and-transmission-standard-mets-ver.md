abstract: The METS Editorial Board is working on version 2 of the Metadata Encoding
  & Transmission Standard (METS), work which aims to make METS easier to use and implement.
  Version 2 simplifies the schema, makes it more consistent, and removes reliance
  on the outdated XLink standard. It aims to retain a clear path for migration from
  METS 1 for most use cases. In this paper the METS Editorial Board presents the changes
  in a short form and invites comments and thoughts on the evolution of METS.
