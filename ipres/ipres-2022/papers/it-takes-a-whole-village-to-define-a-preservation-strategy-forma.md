abstract: After publishing its policy on data formats for digital preservation, the
  National library of France (BnF) had to formalize its method to deal with collected
  data that did not meet its requirements.  This paper describes several significant
  examples that led BnF from preconceptions to pragmatic decisions upon normalization
  and preservation strategies for content that could not be ingested as is.  Collective
  intelligence was highly required; this paper is also intended as an attempt to identify
  which conditions made it possible to emerge between experts, collection managers
  and process managers.<br />Described cases tackle issues with PDFs with protection,
  48 bits images, PSD files, PDF transformation to JPEG and Final Cut Pro projects.  These
  cases helped define empirically a method, still a work in progress, that is briefly
  presented in the last part of the paper.<br />
