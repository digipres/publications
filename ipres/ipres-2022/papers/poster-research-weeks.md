abstract: Technology companies often run ‘hack weeks’ allowing staff to spend some
  time exploring new ideas, developing, learning, and collaborating on something of
  personal interest. The organizational incentive is to reap the benefits derived
  from allowing such freedom to work on a personal project. This practice has been
  used within the digital preservation domain before, the AQuA and SPRUCE projects
  for example, which brought together content holders and developers to quickly develop
  solutions to content challenges. Inspired by this, the digital preservation team
  at the British Library undertook a ‘research week’ to enable staff to focus on some
  digital preservation related work or training they have lacked core time to do;
  to create time for them to innovate. This poster aims to share our experience, share
  how we made it happen, and generally open up discussions on digital preservation
  research and development approaches within organizations.
