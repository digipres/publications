abstract: This poster explores how and why two maturity models, the NDSA Levels of
  Digital Preservation and the DLF Levels of Born-Digital Access, have been embedded
  into a broad management standard for memory institutions (the UK Archive Service
  Accreditation programme), and the results of this approach to date. The poster explains
  the different approaches taken to preservation and access in this embedding, reflecting
  different broad levels of maturity within the UK archive sectorâ€™s digital activity.
  Finally the poster outlines early findings from the implementation and potential
  future developments.
