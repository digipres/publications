abstract: '"Digital preservation is people" and "Digital preservation cannot be done
  alone" are often heard statements within our domain. Nevertheless, no exhaustive
  survey of digital preservation communities had been done. The nestor Digital Preservation
  Community survey closed this gap and the nestor working group "Community Survey"
  is currently working on a publication of the survey results. This short paper presents
  the survey design and process, gives an insight into some of the ﬁndings by using
  the survey results to answer questions about the landscape of digital preservation
  communities and gives a brief outlook on further work.'
