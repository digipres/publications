abstract: 'Digital preservation discourse tends to focus the organisational and technical
  processes required to make data, held in a recognised custodial environment, accessible
  and usable over the long-term. It rarely focuses on data needs requirements across
  the full lifecycle as defined by the DCC Curation Lifecycle Model (ref). This paper
  introduces the problem space for a project in mid-Wales which is taking a holistic
  approach to data curation and preservation. The Tyfu Dyfi food, nature and well-being
  project is supporting and developing agroecological practice in the UNESCO designated
  Dyfi Biosphere towards a more resilient and participatory local food system. Gaps
  in the creation and distribution of data necessary for successful collaborative
  food production and marketing are currently being identified. Next steps are the
  analysis of information flows across the partners to identify requirements for their
  long-term capture and access. '
