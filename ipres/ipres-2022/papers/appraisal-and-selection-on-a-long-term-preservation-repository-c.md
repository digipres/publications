abstract: In this article we describe the way MoReq 2010 has been used to guide the
  development of appraisal and selection workflows in an open-source long-term digital
  repository system. Even though the destruction of records is an irreversible process
  that is deem contrary to the mission of a long-term digital preservation repository,
  we argue that there are enough real-world use case scenarios that justify the need
  to bring these features to digital repositories as well further demystifying the
  idea that digital archives are places where records come to die, and instead reinforce
  the notion that these can used as vessels to revitalize information and support
  operational systems in the day-to-day business operations.
