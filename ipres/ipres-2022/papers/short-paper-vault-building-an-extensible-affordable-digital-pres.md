abstract: 'Since 1996, the Internet Archive (IA) has provided storage, preservation,
  and access infrastructure and services to over 1,000 cultural heritage organisations
  around the world. It has also provided customized digital preservation services
  on a contractual basis to a handful of large institutions. In 2020, IA began building
  a more generalized digital preservation and repository service in response to the
  needs of a broader range of institutions and to leverage IAâ€™s self-owned data centers,
  non-profit cloud services, and demonstrated expertise in both small and petabyte-scale
  digital stewardship. This system is being developed in direct dialogue with 30+
  organizations, including universities, public libraries, arts organizations, and
  cultural heritage organizations, over the course of the 2021 - 2022 year. This paper
  shares key takeaways from the information collected from this pilot phase and early
  launch of the service and also positions the service, Vault, within the digital
  preservation landscape, particularly as it relates to the distinct needs and goals
  of nonprofits, libraries, and cultural heritage organizations, that this service
  aims to address. '
