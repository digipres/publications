abstract: 'Over the course of six weeks, members of the Data Curation Network were
  interviewed by the Assistant Director to discuss their research data preservation
  practices. Through these semi-structured interviews, several commonalities emerged,
  including key challenges that will need to be addressed to ensure the long-term
  reusability of research data as well as the similar mentality many institutions
  expressed: that they are doing the best they can with what they have. The authors
  conclude by identifying areas of potential future research as well as practical
  collaboration opportunities.'
