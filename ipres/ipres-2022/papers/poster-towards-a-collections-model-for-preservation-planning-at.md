abstract: The development of a framework for preservation planning at the British
  Library has highlighted the need for a more-structured understanding of its digital
  collections, in particular with regard to identifying the specific sets of objects
  that would be the focus of preservation plans. Work has recently commenced on developing
  a model of the Libraryâ€™s collections to support this.
