abstract: This paper will examine the work undertaken on DiAGRAM (Digital Archiving
  Graphical Risk Assessment Model) to ensure it is fully compliant with the Web Content
  Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG2.1) and the United Kingdom’s Public Sector Bodies
  Access Regulations (PSBAR). This work also supports The National Archives’ strategic
  goal of becoming the Inclusive Archive.<br />The initial development of DiAGRAM
  aimed to bring the power and insight of Bayesian Networks to the community of digital
  archivists. The prototype tool successfully demonstrated this, however, the relatively
  short project timeframe and adoption of a rapid prototyping approach (with R/Shiny)
  imposed constraints on accessibility. We offer some lessons learned from the project
  in how we could have approached this more effectively.<br />With The National Archives’
  own successful use of the prototype in support of an investment business case for
  improving our digital archive’s resilience the tool’s utility was sufficiently clear
  for a further phase of work. The contract was awarded to data analytics firm Jumping
  Rivers, who had also previously undertaken initial usability and accessibility improvements.
  A full external accessibility review was undertaken by TetraLogical.<br />The first
  part of this new project phase determined that the most appropriate way to proceed
  was to re-architect the DiAGRAM tool to separate the web front-end from the underlying
  model and connect the two via a new set of API endpoints. Opportunity was also taken
  to review the “Advanced customisation” modeling options to improve usability.<br
  />Redevelopment is now substantially complete although the formal retest to confirm
  full compliance with PSBAR is to take place later this month, however ongoing dialog
  with TetraLogical throughout development means no major issues are anticipated.<br
