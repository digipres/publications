abstract: The National Library of Scotland collects, preserves and promotes access
  to films capturing Scotland and her people from the early days of film-making to
  the present day. Around 12 thousand items in the collection are video tapes that
  will soon become inaccessible as playback devices become increasingly obsolete.
  The Library started the Collections On Tape project in 2022 to preserve access to
  this rich culture through an ambitious digitization project due to finish in 2025.
  Around 700 terabytes of data will be created that takes advantage of the ffv1 video
  codec.  The Library will provide unprecedented access to our visitors and video
  specialists and is honored to share key aspects of this project with the preservation
  and moving image community.
