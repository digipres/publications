abstract: 'Through open research, experimentation and convenings with LAM sector peers
  and colleagues, a foundational need has emerged for a broadly shared and evidenced
  set of guidelines for implementing ML and AI technologies that centers the long-term
  stewardship and ethical responsibilities of cultural heritage organizations. Inspired
  by community guidelines that rationalize complex information into an understandable
  framework like the NDSA Level of Digital Preservation and the Data Nutrition Project,
  LC Labs is proposing a step toward collaboratively generating a LAM-specific framework
  for understanding and implementing ML and AI technologies.  '
