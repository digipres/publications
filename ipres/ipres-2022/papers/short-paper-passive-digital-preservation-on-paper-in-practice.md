abstract: Radioactive waste management encompasses timescales ranging from centuries
  to hundreds of thousands of years.  Therefore, it is concerned with the long-term
  preservation of complex analog and digital information that are key to safeguarding
  the environment and human health against the potential threat of radioactive waste.  The
  multi-century timescale and criticality of the radioactive waste repositories call
  for information preservation strategies based on durable, robust and secure data
  carriers and technologies.<br />Andra, the French national radioactive waste management
  agency, uses permanent paper to archive analog material.  Over 2020 and 2021, it
  tested the Micrâ€™Olonys solution from Eupalia, a novel approach to transcribe digital
  data on paper for passive long-term retention and accessibility.<br />This paper
  presents the results of transcribing a database concerning waste packages stored
  at the first repository operated by Andra, producing a 464-page document instead
  of a million pages that plain text printing would have required.<br />
