abstract: Rather than preservation and archiving being an afterthought for digitally
  published works, research is being done to explore how the concepts, processes,
  and requirements of preservation can be embedded into publishing, especially OA
  publishing. How might this be integrated further, and what benefits might extend
  to academics and researchers themselves? Often the difficulties or challenges of
  preservation result from scholarly research being generated and published without
  a preservation policy in mind, which can result in the knowledge becoming lost.
  This has a particularly emphasised effect upon smaller and scholar-led presses,
  who often do not have the inbuilt resilience typically provided by either a large
  business model or a memory institution, which can allow for archiving and preservation
  to occur procedurally. Our panel will consider the workflows involved, potential
  solutions, and what additional engagement may be necessary to increase awareness
  among publishers and researchers. COPIMâ€™s Work Package 7 engages with complex digital
  OA monographs and the scholar-led publishing community. The Mellon-funded Embedding
  Preservability in New Forms of Scholarship project (NYU) embeds digital preservation
  experts with publishers from the beginning of the publishing process to help them
  to make choices that result in publications, including very complex ones, that can
  be preserved at scale. And Project JASPER works with small, independent OA journals
  to facilitate preservation.
