abstract: 'Rhizomeâ€™s ArtBase is a public archive holding cop-ies of more than 800
  works of net art. Most pieces allow for different points of access: they might be
  available live from a Rhizome web server or alterna-tively from a web archive, with
  both versions poten-tially incomplete and in different states of restora-tion. Visitors
  might view these works via a period-adequate browser in an emulator, or whatever
  setup they are running on their devices. Discussed below is a system using technical
  metadata and curatorial in-formation to calculate an access quality score that can
  help visitors choose which artworks, versions, and modes of access will best meet
  their needs.'
