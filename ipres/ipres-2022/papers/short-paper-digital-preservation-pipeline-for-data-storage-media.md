abstract: Bit rot and technical obsolescence are threatening the ability to read data
  storage media received by GLAM institutions. This paper presents the work in progress
  to build a pipeline of autonomous steps to correctly preserve information on data
  storage media. Inspired by video game and computer science preservation communities,
  our pipeline relies on promising open-source software, such as Aaru or HxCFloppyEmulator,
  and hardware such as Pauline. Challenges and limitations of our approach are discussed.
