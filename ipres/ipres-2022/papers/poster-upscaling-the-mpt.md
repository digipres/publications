abstract: The Minimum Preservation Tool (MPT), developed by the British Library, provides
  a local technical digital preservation environment to routinely fixity-check collections
  awaiting ingest into a long-term digital repository. Within the Library this was
  deployed on a standard-provision Virtual Machine using the same SHA-256 hash function
  as our long-term digital repository. This operates effectively for the collections
  currently under MPT control, but to be confident managing larger and more varied
  collections, we look to understand how performance can be improved, for example
  through use of different hash functions or through greater parallelization. This
  poster outlines experimental findings exploring the effect on performance of four
  different hash functions and four sizes of parallel processes, across three broad
  corpora (large, mixed, and small file-sizes).
