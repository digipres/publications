abstract: 'As email and the systems used to preserve it continue to evolve, email
  archiving continues to do so as well. We are approaching a time of community maturity,
  with multiple institutions taking roughly similar approaches to preserve their email
  archives, but with different technologies at different scales and for different
  purposes. This panel will discuss the evolving landscape of email archiving and
  how projects on opposite ends of the spectrum are addressing the strengths and weaknesses
  of their approach. It will also provide attendees an opportunity to assess the projects’
  impacts on the email preservation community. '
