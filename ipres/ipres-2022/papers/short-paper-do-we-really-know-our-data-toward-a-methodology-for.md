abstract: Library and Archives Canada’s (LAC) new File Formats Policy, which constitutes
  a from-scratch analysis of the Preservation area’s migration capacity, has been
  converted into a database that can be remotely queried. In tandem with DROID, we
  developed a new software tool that compares a target dataset (e.g., material for
  acquisition, or material being migrated to a new media) against our PRONOM-based
  Local Digital Format Registry (LDFR) database. The tool then outputs a report –
  which then speaks to LAC’s capacity to manage the target data – and flags detectable
  file format and data management issues. The tool is a major development for LAC
  and enables us to assess file format compliance, preservation tenability, and therefore
  the estimated cost of ownership at the pre-transfer stage of the lifecycle – which
  will inform PAIMAS-oriented discussions with internal and external clients – leading
  to better overall capacity management, and digital preservation migration, planning,
  and sustainability.
