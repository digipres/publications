abstract: We describe how the design of a digital preservation system suitable for
  the long-term archival retention of digital documents mimics conventional archival
  practice with regard to provenance, authenticity and workflow.  The design further
  ensures the evidential nature of digital “documents” in the Archive.  Exit plans
  recognize both the routine expiry of time limited supplier agreements and the effects
  of a disorderly supplier exit.  The design has been successfully implemented and
  is now being migrated from test to production as a “business as usual” component
  of the archivist role.
