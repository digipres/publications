abstract: Selecting a repository system is a task many collecting institutions have
  to carry out at least once. There are many challenges, while the variety of alternatives
  available is a good thing, making sense of the marketplace can be difficult. Assessing
  candidate solutions is time-consuming but it’s difficult to use the work of others
  as every organization has unique requirements. Here we present a simple methodology
  intended to help organizations to narrow the field by putting together a high-level
  set of requirements, placed within the context of the OAIS Reference Model. This
  should help organizations starting on the selection road to make good choices when
  shortlisting solutions.
