abstract: While performing their primary functions as research and education, universities
  also carry out in the ordinary course of activities such as naturally occurring
  personnel employment, procurement and promotion.  As a result of these activities,
  materials with different types are created.  These materials, which are created
  electronically or digitized, are the memory of the universities as well as evidence
  of their activities.  Therefore, these materials need to be preserved for a long
  time.  To predict the success of these materials in terms of long-term preservation,
  it is necessary to examine the capabilities of universities in this field.  While
  doing this review, is thought to benefit from the Rapid Assessment Model (RAM) created
  by Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC).  Because the RAM is designed to evaluate
  the digital preservation capability of organizations at a basic level. As a result
  of this evaluation, it will be possible for universities to improve their digital
  preservation capabilities and monitor their progress.  In this study, in which quantitative
  research methods will be used, Bursa Uludag University, one of the universities
  with the highest number of students in Turkey, is the sample.   The study aims to
  contribute to raising awareness in universities about how DPC RAM can be used in
  the evaluation of digital preservation practices in universities.
