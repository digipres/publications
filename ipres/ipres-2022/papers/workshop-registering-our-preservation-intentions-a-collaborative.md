  data resides make up a critical part of our digital preservation infrastructure.

  utilizing preservation registries along with the wider community of users and contributors.
  It aims to provide a space for discussion on the future of the preservation registries
  landscape, identifying gaps in provision, understanding changing user needs, and
  exploring opportunities for collaboration.
