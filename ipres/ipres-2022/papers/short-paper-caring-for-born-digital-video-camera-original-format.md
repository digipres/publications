abstract: 'Over time, we have seen the exponential growth of born-digital files, specifically
  those created by consumer, prosumer, and professional cameras. This paper is about
  a new issue that is specifically rooted in today''s digital workflows: the maintenance
  of born-digital camera original video formats in an archival setting and the intentional
  irreversible change that may be required to stabilize them for future access.'
