abstract: 'The World Bank Group (WBG) Archives, in partnership with the WBG IT Department,
  has developed a tool to support the appraisal, selection and disposition of video
  recordings. The Archives Video Appraiser (AVA) leverages Machine Learning (ML) to
  make recommendations on which recordings to keep or destroy after having learnt
  from a trusted set of training data. Decisions are validated or corrected by an
  archivist so that AVA can continue to learn from its mistakes. AVAÂ´s current predictions
  are 85% accurate and the use of AVA has resulted in 1.5-person-day savings per month
  and in the reduction of manual mistakes. '
