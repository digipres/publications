abstract: 'Long term digital preservation can benefit from long term storage solutions.
  DNA data storage is a new technology that offers unique benefits to the digital
  preservation community. With the cost of DNA data storage rapidly decreasing Yale
  University Library has partnered with Twist Bioscience to investigate the benefits
  and feasibility of deploying DNA data storage for long term preservation. In this
  paper we discuss DNA data storage, outline the pilot project we have undertaken
  and discuss the technology and its potential future applications. '
