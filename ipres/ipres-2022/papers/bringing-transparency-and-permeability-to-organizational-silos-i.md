abstract: The Ohio State University Libraries established the Digital Preservation
  and Access Workgroup (DP&A) [1] in early 2020 to guide the University Libraries'
  policies, strategies and tactics for managing, preserving and providing access to
  its digital collections. It brings together key individuals from across the organization
  to ensure that information sharing and best practices are reflected throughout the
  organization. The DP&A’s initial charge was to identify our existing workflows that
  affect born digital acquisitions and processing, digitization, providing access
  to digital materials and the preservation thereof. This effort is to aid in answering
  the question, “What are the intersections, gaps, redundancies and areas for improvement?”
  This poster will demonstrate the progress we have made on this project, spotlighting
  the process analysis and improvement techniques we have brought to bear, along with
  our initial recommendations for workflow and organizational improvement.
