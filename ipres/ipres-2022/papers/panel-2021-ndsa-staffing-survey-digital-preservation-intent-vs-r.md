abstract: The 2021 Staffing Survey represents the third iteration of an expansive
  staffing survey to be carried out by the NDSA. The survey and its findings offer
  a unique perspective on digital preservation staffing provision and issues experienced.
  This panel aims to share key findings from the survey with an international audience,
  to place these in the context of the real-world experience of the expert panel,
  and to encourage attendees to engage in a dialogue around digital preservation staffing,
  organizational support, and workforce development within the field.
