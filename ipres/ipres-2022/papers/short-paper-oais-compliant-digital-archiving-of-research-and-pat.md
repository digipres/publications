abstract: Nowadays digital data is produced at an exponential rate. The predominant
  storage and long-term conservation solutions use power-hungry spinning disks. DNA
  technology represents an ideal candidate for storing data because of the optimum
  ratio between energy and density of information it can contain, its relative longevity
  and above all its status at the foundation of life, preserving it from any technological
  obsolescence. Consequently, in this paper we present the design of a scalable archiving
  solution based on DNA, interfaced to OAIS-compliant digital repositories, and which
  allows an effective and efficient implementation on the long term in a perspective
  of saving research and patrimonial information.
