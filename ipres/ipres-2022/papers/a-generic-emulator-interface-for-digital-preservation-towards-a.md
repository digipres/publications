abstract: Emulation frameworks as well as emulation as an access strategy have matured.
  With more simplified access to emulation and improved workflows, there is still
  a gap to be closed, primarily the availability of emulators and especially for smaller
  niches like arcade games or pre-PC computers. In this article we propose methods
  to simplify emulator preparation for framework integration as well as describing
  an emulatorâ€™s technical capabilities. Both, the technical design and the technical
  description of emulators will provide a foundation for cooperative work to identify,
  list, describe and integrate emulators of interest for the digital preservation
  community.
