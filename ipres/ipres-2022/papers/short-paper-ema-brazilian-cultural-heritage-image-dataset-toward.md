abstract: Metadata annotation in digital collections is typically conducted by several
  specialized professionals, configuring a complex, labor-intensive, and time-consuming
  activity, leading to human failure, high costs, and problems in retrieving information
  accordingly. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly Deep Learning
  techniques, have shown their potential in performing visual recognition and interpretation
  of objects on images. In this context, the present work introduces EMA, a Brazilian
  cultural heritage image dataset with over 11,000 labeled images of objects from
  seventeen Brazilian museums. EMA dataset is a contribution towards the development
  of automated metadata annotation tools. The paper also presents baseline ResNet50
  results for the dataset, resulting in an over 86% recognition rate.
