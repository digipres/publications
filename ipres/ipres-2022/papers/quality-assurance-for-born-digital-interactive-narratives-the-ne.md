abstract: 'The UK Legal Deposit Libraries have been researching and building experimental
  collections of emerging formats for the past five years, including curated collections
  of web-based interactive narratives in the UK Web Archive. The New Media Writing
  Prize Collection is one of such collections, created using web archiving tools to
  capture instances of the online interactive works that were shortlisted or won the
  Prize since its launch. This poster briefly outlines the collection, and focuses
  on the quality assurance criteria adopted to assess the quality of the captures.
  These were the result of a short PhD Placement at the British Library and they expand
  on technical criteria to include considerations on the narrative and literary quality
  of digital interactive publications. '
