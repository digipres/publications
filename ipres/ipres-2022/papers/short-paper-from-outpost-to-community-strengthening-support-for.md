abstract: 'The digital preservation workforce is dispersed across organizations, roles,
  and the world. The value of grass-roots communities of practice and membership organizations
  to support digital preservation work are evident with the success of such initiatives
  as the Australasia Preserves regional community of practice supporting practitioners
  in the Australasian region, and the Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC), an international
  charity that works to secure our digital legacy. With DPC members dispersed across
  the globe – and across time zones – engagement can be challenging. In March 2020
  the DPC and the University of Melbourne commenced a partnership to embark on a two-year
  investigative project (2020-2021), to establish a staffed office improving access
  to the DPC’s program of activities for Australasian DPC members and more broadly,
  digital preservation practitioners in the region such as those participating in
  the Australasia Preserves community of practice. In early 2022 the DPC announced
  that this partnership would continue with expansion of the DPC Australasia remit
  and staffing presence following successful project outcomes. This continuation,
  the thriving DPC Australasia Stakeholder Group, and the ongoing development of a
  sustainable business model are undeniable indicators of the success of this project. '
