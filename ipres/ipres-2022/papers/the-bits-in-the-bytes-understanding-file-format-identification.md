abstract: This workshop will provide practical experience of analyzing digital files
  to create signatures for format identification. It will build confidence in file-format
  analysis and develop participantsâ€™ understanding of a range of methods that can
  be applied to different files and content types. We will explore the approaches
  adopted by the major file format identification tools used by the digital preservation
  community. During this workshop, attendees will gain hands-on experience in the
  tools needed to contribute file format research to the open-source registry PRONOM;
  some participants will be analyzing the digits, or hex, of their files for potentially
  the first time. As well as being educational, file format identification is a lot
  of fun!<br />PRONOM as a tool ties in well with the themes of the conference. PRONOM
  is open source and used across the globe in the information management and digital
  preservation sectors, and beyond. It embodies the value of data for all and encourages
  understanding of file formats for future preservation needs.<br />PRONOM particularly
  embodies the key conference themes of community and exchange. We rely on so many
  talented file-format researchers around the world to analyze digital collections,
  flag issues and contribute to our shared knowledge of file formats. We want to continue
  the conversation with the digital preservation community and enable more people
  to participate in this collective endeavor.<br />
