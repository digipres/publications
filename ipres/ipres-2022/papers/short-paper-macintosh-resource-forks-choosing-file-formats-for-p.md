abstract: The preservation of files from early Macintosh Classic (OS <=9) may often
  require special handling in order to ensure long term preservation and rendering.
  The classic Macintosh operating system would use two “forks”, a data fork and a
  resource fork. Resource Forks may contain graphics, sounds, fonts, and additional
  code. In addition, the file system would store two 4 digit codes for each file,
  one identifying the creating software and another identifying the type of file as
  extensions were rarely used. Because of this unique information within the Macintosh
  file system, most modern preservation systems are only aware of the data fork and
  information can be lost. Round-tripping a file through a preservation system and
  back to the original OS can help identify potential loss.
