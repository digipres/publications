abstract: 'The Emulation as a Service Infrastructure (EaaSI) program of work is dedicated
  to ensuring all software is usable forever. In this paper we outline why we believe
  this vision is important, describe the technologies included in the EaaSI software,
  describe some of the challenges we face in realizing this vision, and finally outline
  some of the future developments we are working on to expand the impact of the EaaSI
  program of work.   '
