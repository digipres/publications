abstract: This paper describes the work and outputs of the joint NDA-DPC project “Reliable,
  Robust and Resilient Digital Infrastructure for Nuclear Decommissioning”. This four-year
  project has produced a number of important deliverables that have been widely adopted
  by the international digital preservation community, such as DPC RAM. As a result
  of this project the UK’s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority is now much better placed
  to face the very real digital preservation challenges of the future.
