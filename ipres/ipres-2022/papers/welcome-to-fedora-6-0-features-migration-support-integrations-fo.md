abstract: In July, 2021, the long-awaited Fedora 6.0 was released. This workshop will
  provide an overview of the software itself, a look at our roadmap and path to release,
  as well as dive into some important new features that helped return Fedora to itâ€™s
  digital preservation roots. We will showcase and demonstrate the much-anticipated
  migration tooling and documentation as we work through a hands-on migration. Lastly
  we will demonstrate how to integrate Fedora with your ecosystem via the Camel Toolbox.<br
  /><br />This is a technical workshop pitched at an introductory level so no prior
  Fedora experience is required. General knowledge of the role and functionalities
  of repositories would be beneficial. Attendees who wish to participate in the optional
  hands-on sections will need to access an online sandbox via a URL which will be
  provided ahead of the workshop.
