abstract: As the only institution in the world with an ISO 16363:2012-certified repository,
  the U.S. Government Publishing Office now sets forth to pursue assessment under
  CoreTrustSeal to supplement its internationally recognized certification. While
  ISO 16363:2012 is still recognized as the “gold standard” for digital preservation
  repository certification, GPO believes additional assessment will serve to mitigate
  risks related to the lag in digital preservation community adoption of formal certification
  and potential future unavailability of ISO 16919:2014 accredited certification bodies
  to administer audits. This short paper presents GPO’s work in progress to pursue
  this secondary form of assessment and GPO’s observations and lessons learned as
  an ISO 16363-certified repository thus far.
