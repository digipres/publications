abstract: This paper outlines the recent transfer of a series of high-level Scottish
  Government records to National Records of Scotland (NRS). The records needed to
  be made publicly available almost as soon as they arrived at our archive, and the
  transfers prompted NRS to consider how we could provide online access to born-digital
  records for two distinct use cases. This paper outlines; the background to this
  task, how NRS evaluated the solutions that could be used to deliver online access,
  and lessons learned from an enterprise carried out exclusively within the challenging
  context of the Covid-19 pandemic
