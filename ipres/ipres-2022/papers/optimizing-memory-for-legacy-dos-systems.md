abstract: Running software from the early 19980s and 1990s, often problems are encountered
  due to the limitation of conventional (base) memory. Even though the system may
  have a sizable amount of memory, only conventional memory was used to load and run
  programs. Customizing the system to load other necessary executable files such as
  drivers into memory was required. In this paper, an overview of the memory architecture
  of IBM-compatible personal computers is given and approaches to memory management
  configuration are presented.
