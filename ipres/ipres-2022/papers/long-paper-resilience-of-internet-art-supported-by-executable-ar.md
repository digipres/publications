abstract: 'We present a case study of artist-led reconstruction of Internet art in
  the light of VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) and Flash software obsolescence.
  The study provides insights into ongoing management of technology configurations
  throughout the artwork lifecycle in order to maintain consistency in presentation
  and interaction. Guided by the artist’s requirements for the integrity of the artwork
  exhibition, we evaluated multiple installations and optimized configurations to
  achieve quality (Q), stability (S), longevity (L) and scaled online access (A).
  Installations are explored within the Executable Archive framework, centered on
  the quality assurance through continual software maintenance. The study reveals
  the artist’s priorities that can guide preservation action in relation to technology
  components and the importance of considering artwork access as an integral part
  of the artwork reconstruction process. It demonstrates the resilience of the Internet
  art that can be achieved adopting Executable Archive framework for the management
  of software technologies.  '
