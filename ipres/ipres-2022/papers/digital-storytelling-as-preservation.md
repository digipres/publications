abstract: Mimi Onuoha’s Library of Missing Datasets catalogues datasets that were
  never created and captured, illuminating how cultural values are represented in
  absences of care, of data and of memory. The “archival silence” trope is well recognized
  today, yet in the present some lives, experiences and events continue to be ghosted
  by record-making and institutional collecting and preservation. Digital storytelling
  is one set of techniques that are being used to transmit memories into the future.
  Digital storytelling encompasses a range of formats and methods, from geospatial
  and timeline media, to video essays and podcasts, to simple blogs. In the creation
  of these digital objects, which themselves require preservation, digital storytellers
  can preserve traces of analogue or lived culture and experience, so that preservation
  is enacted by and enacted upon digital stories. Exploring what lost media and memory
  mean for communities today and in the past, this panel presentation will present
  examples of digital storytelling work that is both a means for and an object of
  preservation. By positing digital storytelling as a preservation method, the panel
  will consider issues related to working in community, accessing tools and know-how,
  finding a home for digital objects, and sharing (and deleting) these products of
  memory work.
