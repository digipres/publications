abstract: The Metadata Quality Benchmarks group of the Digital Library Federationâ€™s
  Metadata Assessment Working Group launched a survey in 2019 to gather preliminary
  data about metadata quality assessment and benchmarking practices used in digital
  libraries.  Data gathered included information about the hosting organization; the
  size, scope, and technical aspects of the digital repositories; and quality assessment
  priorities and activities.  Survey analysis revealed several trends and correlations,
  most noticeably in the overall usage frequency of elements, assessment of required
  vs. optional elements, and prioritization of certain quality characteristics and
  evaluation methods.  The authors hope conclusions drawn from this data will spur
  the creation of metadata benchmarks, enhancing the quality and overall impact of
  metadata in resource access and discovery.
