abstract: For research institutions in the humanities and social sciences in Japan,
  it is difficult to maintain and operate data archives on a long-term basis. Therefore,
  the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) launched the "Program for
  Constructing Data Infrastructure for the Humanities and Social Sciences" in FY 2018
  with a five-year timeframe. The program provides (1) the Japan Data Catalog for
  the Humanities and Social Sciences (JDCat) to enhance data discoverability, (2)
  ”A Guide to Data Sharing in the Humanities and Social Sciences”, (3) funding and
  consultation to five institutions, and (4) an online data analysis system. Through
  these activities, the program aims to promote long-term preservation and re-use
  of data in the humanities and social sciences.
