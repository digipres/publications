abstract: The Morrow Plots at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are the
  longest-running continuous experimental agricultural fields in the Americas. This
  paper discusses efforts to identify, curate, and preserve data from the Morrow Plots
  and visualization tools to enhance understanding of the historical and scientific
  context for the data. This ongoing effort to draw attention to the greater scientific
  value of the Morrow Plots and to test data curation and visualization methods underscores
  the importance of interdisciplinary collaborations to curate longitudinal scientific
  data sets.
