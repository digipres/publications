abstract: How can the curatorial processes of the museum be participated by source
  communities [1] but maintain the professional image of a museum [2]? Many museums
  in the western world turn to social media [3]–[5] and consider crowdsourcing a cost-effective
  solution [6]–[9]. However, social media were not universally popular. This study
  performed a case study to examine Geopark as an approach alternative approach to
  community engagement with a Taiwanese regional museum, the Gold Museum in New Taipei
  City. As Gold Museum participates in Chiufen-Chinkuashih-Shueinandong Geopark as
  an eco-museum, this research explored the need of local communities and how local
  communities cooperate with the museum to preserve geoheritage and develop a sustainable
  economy.
