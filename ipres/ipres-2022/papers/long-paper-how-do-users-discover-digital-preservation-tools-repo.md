abstract: While information is available that charts the development of digital preservation
  tools and their use via case studies, less is known about how users discover and
  adopt digital preservation tools in different contexts.  This study reports on a
  short survey of 68 professionals who utilize digital preservation tools, and how
  they discover and adopt those tools. Findings suggest that the role of community
  is important when discovering and adopting tools. Findings were then applied to
  digital preservation education to inform the ways in which tools are taught in formal
  digital preservation education programs.
