abstract: Digital game development is innovative and intersectional, producing cultural
  texts by developing new technology and spanning physical and digital media in a
  relatively unexplored domain that has become academically legitimized only relatively
  recently. As such, it offers fertile ground for designing and evaluating structures
  to help creators, information professionals, and other users organize and share
  the domain, and to expand our knowledge of knowledge organization as well. Our participants
  were tasked with classifying digital game development artifacts from one online
  archive and two physical archives. The resulting data were analyzed with mixed methods,
  generating recommendations for improvements to the taxonomy—including changes to
  terms, structure, and guidance—and insights on evaluation framework.
