abstract: Artists have experimented with cryptocurrency-incentivized distributed ledgers
  such as blockchains since the advent of Bitcoin. In parallel, crypto advocates have
  claimed that distributed ledger protocols will ensure an accessible and immutable
  record of anything registered to it, including artwork. This panel examines this
  idea with nuance, neither buying into the mass deception behind NFT marketing nor
  rejecting the reality that a subset of artists are creating significant, challenging
  works that inherently utilize these technologies. Each of the three panelists considersa
  specific approach to how preservation professionals can keep such works alive. We
  then jointly compare their merits in a variety of preservation contexts.
