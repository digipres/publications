abstract: 'The objective of the Pêle-mél program is to propose a prototype tool for
  exploring and visualizing electronic messages and to test different strategies for
  contextualizing and classifying electronic messages in French, using NLP techniques,
  artificial intelligence and learning. Beyond that, the aim is also to draw conclusions
  on archiving strategies and to theorize the scope of the external knowledge required
  to succeed in this type of project. If the relevance of NLP techniques is proven
  to exploit the information content of e-mails, if experiments have already been
  conducted in English, this program, financed by the French Ministry of Culture,
  innovates on two points: the will to understand messaging systems in their reticular
  context and the deployment of techniques adapted to French. The first results confirm,
  thanks to a detailed analysis of the messages, the interest of large-scale archiving.
  They also show the difficulties linked to the temporal context of the studied mailboxes
  and to the hybrid character of the information supports. The palliative strategies
  put in place are costly but possible. '
