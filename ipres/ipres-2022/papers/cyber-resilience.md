abstract: Data that is at the heart of ransomware attack. Thanks to the rapid digital
  transformation happening today, data has become an organization’s most critical
  asset. <br />Attackers know this very well and target their attack to gain access
  to your critical data. <br />When they have access to your data, attackers can do
  multiple things. They can remove access to your own data by encrypting the contents
  with a key. They also attack data protection techniques to make sure that all restore
  capabilities are deleted. This way they increase the probability that you’ll pay
  for the for the key to unlock your data again. This is known as an encrypting ransomware
  attack. If the value of the content is high, they can also ask to pay a ransom to
  prevent this content from being shared. OR they can use this information for espionage
  and try to remain in stealth modus as long as possible (like SolarWinds attack)<br
  />What is Cyber Resilience and what’s best practice.  Here we’ll take a deeper dive
  at the bigger picture.
