abstract: A skilled workforce is essential to successful digital preservation. But
  how do we define what “skilled” means? Attempts to define knowledge and competencies
  for digital preservation have, so far, largely focused on the issue from the point
  of view of educators. This paper describes work carried out by the Digital Preservation
  Coalition to create a new skills framework that can be deployed for a range of purposes,
  including facilitating recruitment, structuring professional development, auditing
  skills, and reviewing curricula.
