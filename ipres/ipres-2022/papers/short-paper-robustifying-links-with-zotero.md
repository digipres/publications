abstract: Referencing resources on the web has become an integral part of our digital
  scholarship. However, the long-term availability and accessibility of these resources
  has rarely been the focus of significant research and development efforts. In this
  paper we introduce the Zotero Robust Links extension, a tool that helps authors
  create archival copies of referenced web resources and offers robustified HTML code
  that can easily be copied into manuscripts. Our goal with this extension is to provide
  a tool that helps authors contribute to the integrity of the scholarly record.
