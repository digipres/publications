abstract: Before starting a digital preservation project, many things are taken for
  granted that are discovered during the implementation of the project.<br />Each
  implementation of a digital preservation project has its own peculiarities and characteristics,
  but also many similarities. Generally, preparation processes take much longer than
  expected, multiple teams within the organization need to be coordinated, and many
  project details need to be very well planned.<br />In this panel, representatives
  of institutions from different GLAM sectors from different countries (and even continents),
  will speak from their own experience about the lessons learned during the implementation
  of their digital preservation project.
