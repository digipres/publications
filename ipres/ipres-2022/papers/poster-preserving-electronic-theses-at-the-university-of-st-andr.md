abstract: The University of St Andrews Libraries and Museums have been preserving
  and making our PhD theses accessible since they were introduced in 1917. Since 2007
  theses have been required to be submitted in both print and electronic form, the
  electronic files being used to make full text theses digitally available on our
  institutional repository https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/. There have
  been aspirations for progressing to ‘electronic only’ thesis deposit since 20081,
  but this was held back by a lack of digital preservation support and infrastructure.
  However, during the COVID pandemic many students were only able to submit an electronic
  copy of their thesis and print submission was temporarily suspended – forcing a
  temporary move to e-only thesis deposit. This move to ‘e-only’ thesis deposit became
  business as usual in March 2022, pushed by various stakeholders and supported by
  changes to governance, training, and technical solutions.<br />This poster explores
  the emerging good practice, lessons learned, and future steps for preserving electronic
  theses using the University of St Andrews as a case study in ensuring that these
  vital scholarly outputs have integrity, are accessible, and can be used by future
  generations.
