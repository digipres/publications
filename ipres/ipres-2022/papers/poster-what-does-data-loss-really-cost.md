abstract: Jisc and the Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC) have undertaken an anonymous
  surveying exercise in order to unearth the true cost of catastrophic data lossâ€”not
  only in terms of the value of the data, but also the cost of the knock-on effects
  that may only become apparent some considerable time after the event. This poster
  is intended to present the findings from that survey and introduce a final report
  which will help organisations make a stronger case for robust and effective digital
  preservation practice.
