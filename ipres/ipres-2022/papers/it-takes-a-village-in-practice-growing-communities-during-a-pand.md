abstract: What does it take to ensure open-source software (OSS) programs serving
  cultural and scientific heritage are sustainable and enduring? In 2017, the It Takes
  a Village (ITAV) project produced a Guidebook that serves as a reference source
  to help OSS programs plan for long-term sustainability. In 2020, the Institute of
  Museum and Library Services in the United States funded a new phase of It Takes
  a Village work, ITAV in Practice, to create and pilot an adaptable set of tools
  for practical use in planning and managing sustainability for OSS initiatives. It
  Takes a Village in Practice was proposed pre-COVID, but work did not begin until
  after pandemic-related restrictions had spread across our participating programs
  and organizations. This paper shares the challenges, successes, and lessons learned
  as the project team worked to grow and build the ITAV community and resource during
  the pandemic.
