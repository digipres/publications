abstract: 'Preservation Watch is a vital function when it comes to monitoring internal
  and external developments that can benefit or risk digital objects. However, given
  the abundance of developments and risks, it is hard for organizations to keep up.
  As a solution, the Dutch Digital Heritage Network started work on a supra-organizational
  Preservation Watch function led by a group of experts from the field. This paper
  will ex-pand on the scope of the group, our goals, and our stock agenda for this
  year. '
