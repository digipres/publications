abstract: 'Following three years of software development, requirements refinement,
  and testing, we released the integration of EPrints and Archivematica as a plugin
  to EPrints in 2021. This paper will explain how the integration evolved, how we
  implemented it in parallel to a new Archivematica instance at Concordia University,
  and how we are currently using it to preserve the contents of our institutional
  research repository. We will conclude with a discussion of some possible future
  enhancements envisioned for the integration. '
