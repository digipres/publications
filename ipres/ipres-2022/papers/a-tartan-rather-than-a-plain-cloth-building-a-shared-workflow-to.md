abstract: This paper provides a case study of a shared workflow to preserve the oral
  history recordings created through the Regional Ethnology of Scotland Project. This
  workflow has been developed as the first production run of a semi-automated integration
  of Archivematica at the Centre for Research Collections (CRC) at the University
  of Edinburgh. This experience demonstrates that digital preservation, above all,
  is about people and to succeed requires the input of a range of perspectives and
  skillsets.
