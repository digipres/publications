abstract: For decades, email has been a ubiquitous and critical record of humanity.
  The ePADD+ project enhanced the open source email archiving tool, ePADD, with new
  features supporting effective long-term preservation, including additional format
  eligibility, retention of original order, format normalization, preservation and
  provenance metadata, and export for archival repositories. In this tutorial, attendees
  will learn about the new functions offered in ePADD and how they are implemented
  in the workflows of the ePADD+ partner institutions. Authors will do a live demonstration
  of the tool, utilizing the new functions and guiding attendees through optional
  hands-on participation. The authors will engage attendees in a broader discussion
  around the future development road map for ePADD and strengthening the sustainability
  of the community supported tool.
