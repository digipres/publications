abstract: 'This paper proposes a framework to help understand the different ways digital
  preservation goals can achieved, and the contextual factors these choices depend
  on. This is done through a worked example: three different design patterns representing
  the three possible modes of archival information flow, each illustrated with realistic
  examples and practices. By helping a wider audience understand these different approaches,
  we can ensure implementation choices are informed by practice, rather than by default,
  or without even realizing a choice has been made.'
