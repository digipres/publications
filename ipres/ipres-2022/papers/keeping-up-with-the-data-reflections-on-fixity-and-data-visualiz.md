abstract: 'Seeking to use data to drive decision-making in real-time, organizations
  are revolutionizing how they understand, produce, and use information. To sustain
  the value of insights derived from data, digital preservation professionals must
  challenge a core assumption: that data and information workflows will automatically
  produce static objects that can represent a complete record of our times. Using
  the specific example of Tableau data visualization software, I will suggest that
  the only way to support accountability, transparency, and justice via digital preservation
  is to become more active in the data and information lifecycle. To succeed, we must
  invest in collaboration with a broader community: specifically, data and information
  management professionals. '
