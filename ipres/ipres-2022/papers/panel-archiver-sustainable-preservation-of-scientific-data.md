abstract: 'The ARCHIVER project (Archiving and Preservation for Research Environments)
  has spent over 3 years designing, prototyping and piloting innovative new services
  for the Long Term Digital Preservation (LTDP) of scientific datasets.  During the
  project, multiple Data intensive organizations representing several research domains
  (CERN, DESY, PIC and EMBL-EBI) have worked closely and collaboratively with suppliers
  (Arkivum and LIBNOVA) on the research and development of new services and solutions
  for scientific data preservation relevant for the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).
  This panel session will see the ARCHIVER project participants discuss and share
  the experience and lessons learned during the project.  Topics will include: the
  benefits of a collaborative approach between end-users and commercial suppliers;
  the challenges that were addressed along the way and the solutions that were created;  and
  what still needs to be done in order to realize the project vision of sustainable
  digital preservation services for the whole scientific community that address the
  needs of organizations both large and small.  iPRES 2022 comes just two months after
  the end of the final Pilot phase of the ARCHIVER project which makes it an ideal
  time for the ARCHIVER participants to share their insights and experiences with
  the wider LTDP community.'
