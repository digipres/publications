abstract: The storage and use of digital heritage objects produce carbon dioxide (CO2)
  emissions. Cultural heritage organizations can take several measures into consideration
  in order to diminish these CO2 emissions. However, how much CO2 do storage and use
  produce and what measures could have (the most) effect? We examined the CO2 impact
  and possible measures on the basis of a case study. We have focused our investigation
  on the impact of servers, infrastructure, cloud storage and use. But the story does
  not end there. We look ahead, beyond the case study and beyond boundaries, introducing
  a research agenda within the Dutch Digital Heritage Network (DDHN).
