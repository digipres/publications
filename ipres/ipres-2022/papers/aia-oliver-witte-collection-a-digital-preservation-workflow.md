abstract: In 2017, the Canadian Center for Architecture (CCA) collaborated with the
  American Institute of Architects (AIA) and Yale University to help preserve a collection
  of architectural software solutions from Oliver Witte, a writer and reviewer of
  CAD and CAD related software. The project consisted of disk imaging over 700 obsolete
  software, migrating them in the OAIS-compliant software preservation system, Archivematica,
  and finally using SCOPE, a born-digital archives access interface built by the CCA
  and Artefactual Systems. In addition, the CCA aims to use the Emulation as a Service
  Infrastructure (EaaSI) which would help view documents in their legacy environment.
  What makes this project unique is the CCA’s collaboration with the AIA, and the
  considerable volume of the software collection.<br /><br />Elisabeth Genest is a
  Digital Archives Technician at the Canadian Center of Architecture (CCA). Since
  joining the CCA in 2021, Elisabeth has been working on the completion of the AIA/Oliver
  Witte collection project. This consists of disk imaging floppy disks, CD’s and other
  types of media to stabilize the entire collection while using various software solutions
  and computer systems.<br />Elisabeth holds a Certificate and Dean's list honour
  in Archives and Document Management from the University of Quebec in Montreal and
  a BSc. in Economics from the University of Montreal. This fall, she will be starting
  a master’s program at the University of Montreal in Information Science (MLIS),
  with a concentration in archives.<br />
