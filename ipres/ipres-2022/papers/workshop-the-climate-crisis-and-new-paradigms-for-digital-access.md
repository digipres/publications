abstract: The need for action on the climate crisis is more urgent than ever, and
  our demand for energy to power both storage and access to data is merely fueling
  the emergency. This workshop will look at the different pressures on born-digital
  archives, digitized records and their respective uses by researchers - of all disciplines
  - but with a particular focus on digital humanities. Based on Climate Crisis initiatives
  across both the digital humanities and digital preservation sectors, participants
  will consider the extent to which the expectations of access to digital materials
  are derived from older paradigms, and how we as a community can plan and advocate
  for alternatives.
