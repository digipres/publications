abstract: 'The E-ARK Consortium has been working steadily over the last ten years
  to provide specifications, tools, and best practices for digital archiving across
  Europe and beyond. The E-ARK Consortium has grown over the years and the work has
  taken place under different auspices: first as an EC-funded PSP CIP pilot B project,
  then as the eArchiving Building Block under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF)
  banner. <br />The CEF Programme has just finished and eArchiving will be continuing
  under the Digital Europe Programme (DEP). This paper comprises the eArchiving Building
  Block results, benefits, and Consortium member use cases as presented at the DLM
  Forum meeting in October 2021.'
