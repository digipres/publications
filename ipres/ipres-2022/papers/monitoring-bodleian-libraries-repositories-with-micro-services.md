abstract: The Digital Preservation Micro Services and Reporting (DPMS) service is
  Bodleian Libraries’ monitoring system for digital collections. DPMS interacts with
  the storage layer of the Libraries’ existing repository systems. This method is
  an alternative to the monolithic systems model for digital preservation [1]. The
  decoupled nature of DPMS has meant that preservation tools could be incorporated
  into the Libraries’ existing repository services, without needing to migrate assets
  to a separate digital preservation platform.  <br />This paper outlines how the
  DPMS service was developed. It describes the components of DPMS’s technical framework
  and the process of implementing it in Bodleian Libraries’ digital repositories
