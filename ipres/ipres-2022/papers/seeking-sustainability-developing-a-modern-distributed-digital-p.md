abstract: 'As modern commercial developments in storage infrastructure mature and
  become increasingly available through popular open-source projects, there are important
  opportunities for digital preservation communities to leverage the increased efficiency
  and flexibility that these technologies offer. Not only do these developments offer
  a way to “modernize” the digital preservation technology stack and make it more
  efficient, but they also may allow digital preservation communities to seek increased
  sustainability per the triple bottom line: reduce the costs of operations, reduce
  required labor to maintain, and reduce the environmental impact. The twin values
  of affordability and sustainability are core to the mission of digital preservation,
  and the MetaArchive Cooperative is pursuing the research and development of a modern
  distributed digital preservation system to better practice these values.<br />Since
  its inception in 2004, MetaArchive has used Stanford University’s Lots of Copies
  Keep Stuff Safe (LOCKSS) software for its core infrastructure to achieve distributed
  digital preservation. While LOCKSS has been reliable software for many years, recent
  evaluations by MetaArchive and a desire to make its practices more sustainable have
  led to MetaArchive partnering with Keeper Technology to explore software-defined
  storage and function-as-a-service technologies for digital preservation. The results
  of this multi-phase project will be shared with the digital preservation community,
  with the hopes that it will encourage other digital preservation technological developments
  with a similar sustainability mindset.'
