abstract: This paper concerns a current pilot study relating to contemporary popular
  music created on digital audio workstation (DAW) software, being undertaken at the
  Alexander Turnbull Library (part of the National Library of New Zealand Te Puna
  Mātauranga o Aotearoa). For the pilot we have collaborated with New Zealand music
  artist Luke Rowell to archive the production components for two albums. The study
  addresses the reality that, where music production once involved physical media
  such as magnetic tape, for the last 25 years it has largely shifted to the digital
  domain. While preserving the final musical product released to the public remains
  technically straight-forward, documenting the processes which artists now employ
  in digital production is far more challenging.<br />This paper will begin with some
  background about Luke Rowell’s music, then consider DAW software and the archival
  challenges it presents. We will then cover the approaches taken by the Library and
  our progress to date.<br />
