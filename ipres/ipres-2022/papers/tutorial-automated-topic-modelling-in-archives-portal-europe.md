abstract: ' <br />Archives Portal Europe (APE, www.archivesportaleurope.net) is the
  portal of European archives, an aggregator that connects on a single research point
  the catalogues and digitised archival material of all archives in and about Europe.
  It currently hosts material from more than 30 countries and in 24 languages, and
  from a variety of archival institutions (such as State and city archives,  university
  and parish archives, private institutions, etc). In order to navigate this extremely
  heterogeneous material, one of the research tools made available by Archives Portal
  Europe is by “topics”, curated collections in which each archival institution participating
  into the APE project can tag its documents according to a specific topic. Because
  topics are maintained manually by the archivists, and because of the vast amount
  of archival material ingested in the portal, it is impossible to have a comprehensive
  body of topics that describe the whole of the APE repository. <br /><br />In this
  scenario, automated topic detection can be a fundamental tool to guide archival
  research and to allow archives to be accessible to potentially world-wide users,
  in a situation where national and linguistics barriers blur, or are re-defined.
  <br /><br />This workshop presents the creation of an AI tool for automated topic
  detection in the APE corpus, a vast, inhomogeneous, and multi-lingual collection
  of historical archival catalogues – the first such project to be designed for archival
  descriptions rather than corpora of specific documents. <br /><br />The development
  is based on supervised machine learning, with a combination of human inputs in different
  languages (collectively-created taxonomies for each topic), and the usage of Wikipedia
  pages to model the relevant vocabulary and entities. The first iteration of the
  algorithm was tested on a sample of 9 topics in 5 languages, and the second iteration
  enlarged the sample to 13 topics and 12 languages, for a total of more than 500,000
  descriptive units, and it also introduced Boolean operators and wildcards. <br /><br
  />The workshop will explain how the tool was built, and will allow users to test
  it live, gathering feedback on its usability and possible future implementations
  outside of the specific corpus of Archives Portal Europe. <br />'
