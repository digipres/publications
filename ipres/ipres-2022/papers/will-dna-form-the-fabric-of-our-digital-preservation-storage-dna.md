abstract: DNA data storage is on the cusp of becoming an economical technology which
  could be adopted by the digital preservation community. Many long-lived media technologies
  have fallen by the wayside after failing to meet the needs of digital preservationists.
  Does DNA Storage have the potential to break this trend and offer new capabilities
  in long-term archiving? This panel will consider whether DNA data storage can meet
  the requirements of digital preservationists. It will discuss where DNA might fit
  into a storage strategy, and debate what needs to happen to transform the potential
  into a viable product for this community.
